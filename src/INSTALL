This is a brief description of how to install the CD driver:

To use the driver you will need.

gcc 		3.3
gnu libc 	2.3
make		3.80
bison		1.875

Make a directory 'mud', which contains directories named 'src', 'bin' and
'lib'. Move the game driver source (this code) to the src directory.

Copy Makefile.default to Makefile and uncomment the proper definitions for
compiling on your system.  If your system is not one of those listed, you
will have to create a section for it.  You will want to try compiling the
driver with empty MISSING_OBJ and MISSING_SRC variables; add only objects
required to successfully compile the driver.  Pay special attention to the
version of yacc being used.  AT&T yacc will NOT work.  byacc (standard on
some systems) is the preferred yacc to use, GNU bison will also work.

Make sure the MUD_LIB and BINDIR variables in your Makefile reflects where
the mud's binaries and mudlib will be placed.

There are several allocators supported by the driver.  The preferred one
is "bibop", and is also the default.

If you are going to do driver development it is recommended that you enable
the DEBUG option in your Makefile as well.  You may want to look over the
options in config.h and tailor those for your system.

To actually build the driver, do 'make' and 'make utils'.  If you would
like to run a regression test of the driver before installing, do 'make
check'.

To install the driver, do 'make install' and 'make install.utils'.

Get a mudlib and install it in the 'lib' directory. The most current version
of the CDLIB mudlib is available from ftp.cd.chalmers.se in the directory
pub/cdlib.

Test the game with 'driver &'.

If you see the message 'Setting up ipc', then you are up and running.
Test with 'telnet localhost 4000' (or the portnumber you specified in the
config.h file, if you changed it).

If you want the game to restart automatically, use 'bin/restart_mud'.
