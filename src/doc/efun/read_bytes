NAME
	read_bytes - read text from a given position in a file

SYNOPSIS
	string read_bytes(string filename, void|int fromchar, void|int numchar)

DESCRIPTION
	Gives the contents of the file 'filename'. If the optional arguments
	'fromchar' and 'numchar' are given then the function gives the contents
	from byte 'fromchar' and the following bytes for a total of 'numchar'
	bytes. If the length of the file is smaller than 'fromchar' + 'numchar'
	only the bytes from 'fromchar' to the end of the file are returned.
	If 'fromchar' is negative it is taken to be a count from the end of
	the file. If 0 or less characters are to be returned the return value
	is 0.

NOTA BENE
	There is a maximum limit to the number of bytes that can be read. This
	limit is defined when the gamedriver is compiled and is normally
	50Kbytes.
