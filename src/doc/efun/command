NAME
	command - execute a command in a living object

SYNOPSIS
	int command(string command)

DESCRIPTION
	With this function an object can command itself to perform
	an action that previously has been added with add_action.
	The given string `command' should be on the same format as
	if it had been given from the command line.

	`command()' returns the number eval-cycles that was used to perform
	the command, or 0 if it proved impossble due to eval-cost.

	A force function can then simply be implemented in the player-
	object like this:

	nomask int /* We'd rather not have anyone shadowing this function */
	force_player(string command)
	{
	    if (ok_to_force())
	        if (command(command))
	   	    return 1;

	    return 0;
	}

	The function `ok_to_force()' can then determine if it is permitted
	for the person that tries to execute the command to force the
	player or not.
