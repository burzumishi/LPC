NAME
	wildmatch

SYNOPSIS
	int wildmatch(string pattern, string subject)

DESCRIPTION
	wildmatch will return 1 if the `subject' matches
	the `pattern'.  The patterns used by wildmatch
	are similar to those used in file name matching
	by UNIX shells.

	Most characters match only themselves in the pattern,
	but the following are special:
		*	- matches any number of any characters
		?	- matches any characters
		[xyz]	- matches any characters in xyz
		[^xyz]	- matches any characters not in xyz
		\c	- matches c even if c is special

	Examples:
		wildmatch("*.foo", "bar.foo") == 1
		wildmatch("*.foo", "foo.bar") == 0
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "axy") == 1
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "dxy") == 0
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "a") == 0
