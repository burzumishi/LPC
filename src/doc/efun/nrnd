NAME
	nrnd - return a normally distributed random floating-point value

SYNOPSIS
	float nrnd([float mean[, float stdev]])
	
DESCRIPTION
	Returns a normally distributed random floating-point value.
	With no arguments nrnd() returns a random value with a mean
	of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0.  The caller may
	specify values for the mean and standard deviation, in which case
	the value:

		mean + nrnd() * stdev

	is returned.

NOTA BENE
	Be certain to use ftoi() to convert the floating-point value to
	an integer value as appropriate, this is not done automatically.
	Also note, normally distributed random numbers have probability
	distributions such that 75% of all values should fall within one
	standard deviation, 96% of all random values should fall within
	two standard devations, and 99% of all random values should fall
	within three standard deviations.  However, it is possible
	that random values could exceed three standard deviations.
	Therefore, when using nrnd() be certain to limit the upper and
	lower bounds to protect against excessively large or small values.
