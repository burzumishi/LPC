NAME
	process_value - give a value from a described function call

SYNOPSIS
	mixed process_value(string calldescription, void | int security)

DESCRIPTION
	Get the replacement of one syntactic pattern. The pattern is on
	the form:

		   "function[:filename][|arg1|arg2....|argN]"

	The returned value can be of any type.

  	Note that both object and arguments are marked optional with the
	brackets and that the brackets are not included in the actual pattern.

	If the security parameter is specified and non-zero, the call is
	generated with a special object marked as the generator. The
	object is provided by the function "get_vbfc_object". This object
	will normally be one without any privileges.

SEE ALSO
	process_string

CAVEAT
	This is usually used to support 'value by function call' in the mudlib.
	It is wise to set the security parameter of the process_value
	call, as any function in any object can be called with almost
	any arguments. You probably don't want to have this done with your
	privileges.
