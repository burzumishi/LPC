NAME
	call_self, call_selfv - call a function in this object
	
SYNOPSIS
	mixed call_self(string func, ...)

	mixed call_selfv(string func, mixed *argarr)

DESCRIPTION
	This function is used to call another function in this object.

	`func' should simply be the name of the function to be called.
	Any number of arguments to the function can be added to the
	call. The reason to use this function instead of a direct call
	is that the name of the function need not be know at compile time,
	and that functions that are declared static or private can be
	accessed as oposed to call_other(). In the second form (call_selfv())
	the elements in argarr will be sent as arguments to the function,
	i.e. if sizeof(argarr) == 3 the function will be called with 3
	arguments.

	Examples:

	name = (string)call_self("query_real_name");
	
NOTA BENE
	The default type of "call_self()" is mixed, but as shown in the
	example above it is always possible to cast to a type of your
	own choosing, if nothing else only to aid memory.

SEE ALSO
	call_other()
