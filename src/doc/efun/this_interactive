NAME
	this_interactive - give the originator of the current execution

SYNOPSIS
	object this_interactive()

DESCRIPTION
	Gives the player that is the cause of the current execution chain.
	This is always an interactive player or 0. It is 0 if the current
	execution is caused by heartbeat or callout.

	This is never changed in functions like command, move_object etc.

NOTA BENE
	Do not use this_interactive as a replacement for this_player. There
	several occasions when this will cause errors. Most worth noting
	is when a command() is executed. this_player will then change to 
	reflect the new current player, but this_interactive will not.	

SEE ALSO
	this_player, set_this_player
