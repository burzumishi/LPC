NAME
	regexp - match a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
	string regexp(string *array, string pattern)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns an array containing all matches of `pattern' in the
	strings contained in `array'.

	The rules for this operation is somewhat hazy, I haven't had
	the energy to penetrate the rather large bulk of code that
	takes care of this so for now you'll have to read the source
	code for yourself if you're interested.

	However, it seems that the rules are the same as for UNIX
	`grep', but don't count on it until you have verified by
	testing.
