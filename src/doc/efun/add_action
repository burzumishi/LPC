NAME
	add_action - add an action to an object
	
SYNOPSIS
	void add_action(function func, string verb, void|int part)

DESCRIPTION
	This function adds an action to the `living' object that
	the command is run by. `func' is the function that is to
        be run when the command verb `verb' is given.

	If `part' is 1, only a part of the given verb needs to be
        given for the command to work

	For example:

	    add_action(foobar, "tele", 1);
	    
        will match on "tele" or "teleledning" while the whole verb
	"teleledningsanka" will have to be given for this expression:

	    add_action(foobar, "teleledningsanka", 0); or
	    add_action(foobar, "teleledningsanka");

        If `part' is 2, no spaces are required after the verb.  This
        is useful for adding commands similar to the "'" command.


NOTA BENE
	For this action to be added to an object, the object must be
	`living', i.e. the function "enable_commands()" must have been
	performed in the object prior to the "add_action()".
