This is an ancient bugs file, I have removed most of it, but the following
items are worth looking into. Sometime...


Pattern matching doesn't seem to work any longer.

A lot of calls to xalloc() should be replaced with alloca().

Are sentences freed twice when destructing objects ? Second time,
no sentences will remain.

Only the first two arguments to efuns have their types checked, and only
at run time. Not at compile time. The data structure should be enhanced.

Can 'user' for a player object be 0 ?

Memory is lost when compilation gives errors.

Should be able to handle empty objects (without programs). Maybe it can ?
