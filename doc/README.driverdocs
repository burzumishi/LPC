	for driver version 3.2.1@133, and 3.2@316

AUTHOR
	These man pages were collected from the original 2.4.5 docs,
	from the installed docs of Nightfall, TubMud and MorgenGrauen.

	They were collected corrected and completed Pepel@Nightfall,
	with assistance and support by the LPC wizards of Nightfall,
	TubMud, MorgenGrauen and TAPPMud, namely Hyp, Macbeth,
	Mateese, and Marcus. Also to mention are Bumblebee, Boing,
	Deepthought, Demos, Hate and Jof.

	A bunch of bug fixes for the docs was received from
	Symmetry@Tmi-2

DESCRIPTION
	These man pages are organised in chapters, that are stored in
	separate directories. A reference to foo(X) means the function
	foo as descibed in chapter X, where X is one of:

	A for applied/	member functions (lfuns) that the driver applies
			to objects
	C for concepts/	general concepts of LPMUD and LPC
	D for driver/	some info about internal operation of the driver
	E for efun/	the ``system calls'' of LPC
	LPC for LPC/	about parts of the LPC language
	M for master/	lfuns that are applied to the master object only

 	This collection does not contain anything about mudlib specific
	object classes or lfuns, and also not about any simulated
	efuns (from the simul_efun object), because all these are not
	specific for the driver but for the particular installation.

	Man-pages for the functions in the installation's simul_efun
	object could go e.g. into the chapter SE (directory sefun/),
	man pages for the standard objects (base classes) of the mudlib
	would e.g. fit into chapter S (directory std/).


	The man pages generally adhere to the following format, which
	was inspired by the Unix man pages.

	<manpage> ::= <section>+

	There are one or more sections in a man page.

	<section> ::= <section-name><newline><section-text><newline>

	The section names are always at the beginning of a line, and
	in all capital letters (debatable uglyness).

	<section-name> ::=   'NAME' | 'CONCEPT' | 'SYNOPSIS'
			   | 'LAST UPDATED'
			   | 'SYNTAX' | 'DESCRIPTION' | 'AUTHOR' | 'BUGS'
			   | 'CAVEATS' | 'WARNING' | 'NOTE' | 'NOTES'
			   | 'EXAMPLE' | 'EXAMPLES' | 'HISTORY'
			   | 'SEE ALSO'

	If a NAME or CONCEPT section occurs, it should give the name of
	the man page.
	If a SYNOPSIS section occurs, the name of the man page can be
	derived from the function name, that appears in the line after
	SYNOPSIS, which looks as follows:

	<returntype><space>['*']<function-name>'('<parameter-prototypes>

	SEE ALSO is followed by one or more lines that contain
	crossreferences of the form

	<crossreferences> ::=
		<crossref>[','<white-space><crossref>]*<white-space><EOF>
	<crossref> ::= <man-page-name>'('<chapter-abbrev>')'

	The names of the referenced man pages are followed in brackets
	by an abbreveiation for the chaper (i.e. directory) the man
	page is in. The abbrevs are

	If you want to process these man pages by some converter
	program, you can use these to map the chapter names to file
	names or whatever. There should be some sample awk scripts or
	the like near this README file.

BUGS
	There are almost no man pages supported by Amylaar himself.
	I hope one day I can convince him to at least put these docs
	into the driver distribution.

	Meanwhile, please report any corrections / suggestions /
	completions to <pepel@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>
