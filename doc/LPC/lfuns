CONCEPT
	lfuns

DESCRIPTION
	A lfun is a LPC function within an object which is public and can
	be called by other objects. In OO terms, lfuns are "methods"
	which you can send "messages" to.

	Calling lfuns is done by using the efun call_other(), which
	takes as arguments the object in which the lfun is to be called,
	the name of the lfun to be called in the object, and additional
	and optional arguments.

	An example looks like this:

	call_other(drink, "QueryShort");

	This call may also be written as 

	drink->QueryShort();

	This means call_other(object, "function", args...) can also be
	written as object->function(args...). The second form is
	preferred as it is easier to read.

	Some lfuns have a special meaning for the LPC driver, because
	they are applied by the interpreter instead from an LPC object.
	To distinguish those, they are called ``applied lfuns''.
