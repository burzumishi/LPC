DESCRIPTION
	Searching is done with:
	/hello/
	Find first line in of after current line.
	Just // will repeat the search.

	The patterns are regular expressions, where some characters
	have a special meaning:
	.	Match any character.
	x*	Match any numbers of x (0 or more).
	[abc]	Match 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
	[0-9]	Match any digit 0 - 9.
	[a-z]	Match any lowercase letter.
	\x	Match 'x' where 'x' can be any character except '('
		and ')'.

EXAMPLE
	s/ab.d/ABCD/
	Substitute any string 'abXd' against 'ABCD' where X can be any
	character.

NOTE
	This only half the truth, there is lots more magic in the
	regexps.
