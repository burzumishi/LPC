CONCEPT
	inheritance

DESCRIPTION
	An object can inherit all variables and functions from another
	object. This is done with the declaration 'inherit "file";'.
	This must come before any local variables or functions.

	An example, defining a monster:

	inherit "obj/monster";

	reset(arg) {
	    ::reset(arg);
	    set_name("troll");
	    set_level(9);
	    set_hp(100);
	    set_wc(12);
	    set_al(-60);
	    set_short("A troll");
	    set_long("It is a nasty troll that looks very aggressive.\n");
	    set_aggressive(1);
	}

NOTE
	Nowadays, inheritance has much more things to offer.
	Description will follow eventually.
