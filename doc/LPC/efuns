CONCEPT
	efuns

DESCRIPTION
	Efuns are "system calls" in the LPC driver, the C program
	which compiles and executes the LPC programs of the mudlib.
	These are hardcoded functions which perform basic tasks which
	would be ineffective or impossible to be implemented in the
	mudlib.

	There are efuns for accessing the underlying filesystem, for
	creating, moving and destructing objects, for writing 
	messages to users, for manipulation of LPC data types.
