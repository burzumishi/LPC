NAME
	for

SYNTAX
	for(expr1; expr2; expr3) statement;

DESCRIPTION
	Execute 'expr1' once. Then, while 'expr2' returns a non-zero
	value, execute 'statement'. Every time 'statement' has been
	executed, or a 'continue' statement has been executed, execute
	'expr3' before next loop. 

	A 'break' in the 'statement' will terminate the loop. A
	'continue' will continue the execution from the beginning of
	the loop.
