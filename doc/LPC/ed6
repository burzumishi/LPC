DESCRIPTION
	This is the list of extended ed commands that Xio unearthed
	somewhere, thanks!

	a) never use 1,$p to print out an editfile, because you will
	  be thrown out 'cause of too much text transfereed to you.

	b) $: jump to end of file.

	c) ?anything? and ?? : search from bottom to up. (like '/'
	   from beginning to end of file. (also with substitutions,
	   try out..)

	d) ( g/xxx/p search global xxx and print corresponding lines,
	   /xxx/s/new/old/p : search xxx, substitute new to old in this
	   line and print out. (try this concatenations with other
	   commands)

	e) 1,nmx ( see ed5 ) , but also: 1,ntx : don't move the lines,
	   but make a copy of them.

	f) x,y w name : save lines x to y to file name (if you don't
	   know the line numbers : '=' current line number)

	g) s/$/text/p : append text to the end of current LINE and
	   print line

	h) s/^/text/p : insert text at beginning og current LINE and
	   print line
