NAME
	ed0

DESCRIPTION
	When in 'ed', the prompt is ':'.

	Ed has two modes, command mode and insert mode. The insert
	mode has no prompt. You exit the insert mode by typing a
	single '.' on a line.

	All commands have the following syntax:

	X,Ycmd

	or

	Xcmd

	For example:

	1,10p
	Will print line 1 to 10.
	1,5d
	Will delete line 1 to 5.
	8p
	Will print line 8.
	A '.' is the "current line". The current line is the last line
	referenced. If you want to print last line + 10 more:
	.,.+10p

NOTE
	These manpages seem a bit antique, though still correct. For a
	better detailed help, invoke ed and use the ``h'' command.
	Also you could look into the man page for ed(1) on you nearest
	Unix box. And for a bit of fun you can try the good old
	quiz(6), invoke as ``quiz function ed-command''.
