NAME
	opcdump

DESCRIPTION
	If the driver was compiled to do opcode profiling, this command
	will show the collected profiling information.
        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

        malloc(D), status(D), memory(C), objects(C), debug_info(E),
        set_is_wizard(E)
