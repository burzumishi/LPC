NAME
	dumpallobj

DESCRIPTION
	Write a list of all loaded or cloned objects into the file
	OBJ_DUMP in the root directory of the mudlib.

	Warning: this file can be very large, and if the driver is low 
	on memory there is a certain crash probability.

        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

SEE ALSO
        malloc(D), status(D), memory(C), objects(C), debug_info(E),
        set_is_wizard(E)
