SYNOPSIS
	void notify_shutdown (void)

DESCRIPTION
	Notify the master about an immediate shutdown.

	If the gamedriver shuts down, this is the last function called
	before the mud shuts down the udp connections and the
	accepting socket for new players.
	The function has the opportunity to perform any cleanup
	operation, like informing the mudwho server that the mud is
	down. This can not be done when remove_player() is called
	because the udp connectivity is already gone then.

	slow_shut_down(M), remove_player(M),
