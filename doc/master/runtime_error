SYNOPSIS
	void runtime_error(string err, string prg, string curobj, int line)

DESCRIPTION
	This function has to announce a runtime error to the active
	user. If the user has enough privileges, it might give him the
	full error message together with the source line. Else it
	should issue a decent message ("Your sensitive mind notices a
	wrongness in the fabric of space").

	Note that prg denotes the program actually executed (which
	might be an inherited one) whereas curobj is just the
	offending object.

SEE ALSO
	log_error(M), heart_beat_error(M), raise_error(E), expand_define(E)
