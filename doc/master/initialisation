SYNOPSIS
	Initialization of the master object (since 3.2.1).

	As since 3.2.1 the lfuns which are called to initialize
	objects after a load are defined through driver hooks, and
	these hooks are cleared prior to a master (re)load, the first
	function called is inaugurate_master(). Anyway it's not very
	sensible to do anything earlier as the master is not
	recognized as such at that time, and so a number of
	(important) things would not work.
	Which lfun is called during runtime to reset the master is also
	depending on the driverhook settings. Arbitrary actions may be done
	on a reset.

SEE ALSO
	inaugurate_master(M)
