SYNOPSIS
	string creator_file(mixed ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Return the name of the creator of a newly created object, i.e.
	the name of the user that is responsible for the LPC source
	file the object was loaded from. If the function returns 0,
	the object can't be loaded and is destructed again
	immediately.

	In !compat mode, the returned string serves as the initial uid
	(``cuid'') of the object. Objects whose cuid is the
	backbone-id will then get the uid of the currently active user
	as their userid instead.

	Under compat mode this function is called as well.

	If this function is not provided by the master object, no
	other object can be loaded.

HISTORY
	Dropped in 3.2.1
