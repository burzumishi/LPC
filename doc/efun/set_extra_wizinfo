SYNOPSIS
	mixed set_extra_wizinfo(object|string|int arg, mixed extra)

DESCRIPTION
	Sets the extra information that was set for the given
	argument in the	wizlist. 
	If the argument is an object, then the data is set in the creator
	entry for this object.
	If the argument is a string, it is the name of the entry to be
	set, e.g. a uid.
	If the argument is a number (should be 0 then), the data is set
	in the default wizlist entry. It can be used to	store data for
	the lifetime of this driver run, like the time of the last
	reboot.

	The function causes a privilege violation.
