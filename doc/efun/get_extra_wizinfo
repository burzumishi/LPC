SYNOPSIS
	mixed get_extra_wizinfo(object|string|int arg)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns the extra information that was set for the given
	argument in the	wizlist. 
	If the argument is an object, then the data set in the creator
	entry for this object is returned.
	If the argument is a string, it is the name of the entry to be
	queried, e.g. a uid.
	If the argument is a number (should be 0 then), the data set
	in the default wizlist entry is returned. It can be used to
	store data for the lifetime of this driver run, like the time
	of the last reboot.

	The function causes a privilege violation.
