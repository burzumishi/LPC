SYNOPSIS
	mapping map_mapping(mapping m, string func, object ob, ...)
	mapping map_mapping(mapping m, closure cl, ...)

DESCRIPTION
	ob->func() is called resp. cl applied to every element in the
	mapping, with first argument the first data item of the
	element, and then the extra args that were given to
	map_mapping. The data item in the mapping is replaced by the
	return value of the function. ob can also be a file_name of an
	object. If the second arg is a string and the third is not an
	object, this_object() will be used as default.
	Note that if mapping m has more than one value per key, these
	are ignored: the resulting mapping always has one value per key.
