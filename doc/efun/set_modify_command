SYNOPSIS
	object set_modify_command(object)
	object set_modify_command(string)
	object set_modify_command(int)

DESCRIPTION
	All commands for the current object (that must obviously be
	interactive) will be passed to ob->modify_command() before
	actually being executed. The argument can be passed an object
	or a file_name.

	When set_modify_command() was called, the parser won't expand
	the standard abbreviations n,e,s,w,nw,sw,ne,se for that user
	anymore, nor use any hook set for this.

	0 as argument will stop the command modification and reinstall
	the standard abbreviations.
	-1 as argument will just return the object previously set.

	The return value is the object that was previously set with
	set_modify_command(), if any.

	This mechanism is intended to expand aliases on quicktypers
	or the like.

HISTORY
	Up to 3.2.1@108 the lfun called was hardcoded as
	'modify_command'. The hook H_MODIFY_COMMAND_FNAME introduced
	in 3.2.1@109 allows to change the name.
