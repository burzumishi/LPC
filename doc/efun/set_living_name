SYNOPSIS
	void set_living_name(string name)

DESCRIPTION
	Set a living name on an object. The name will be entered into
	the hash table for the living names, but find_living() will
	only find it after the object has actually been marked as
	``being alive'' by calling enable_commands(). When this is done,
	the object can be found with find_living().
	
	An object can only have one name that can be searched for with
	find_living().

HISTORY
	Since 3.2.1@40, this is a simulated efun. The handling of
	living names is no longer part of the driver.

	find_living(E), find_player(E), enable_commands(E)
