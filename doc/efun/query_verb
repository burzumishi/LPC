SYNOPSIS
	string query_verb(void)

DESCRIPTION
	Give the name of the current command, or 0 if not executing
	from a command. This allows add_action() of several commands
	to the same function. query_verb() returns 0 when invoked by a
	function which was started by a call_out or the heart beat.
	Also when a user logs in query_verb() returns 0.

EXAMPLE
	void init() {
	   ...
	   add_action("sing","sing");
	   ...
	}
	int sing(string str) {
	   write("Your command was:"+query_verb()+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
	   return 1;
	}
	
	When ever you type "sing ..." you get "Your command was: sing ...".
