SYNOPSIS
	string function_exists(string str, object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Return the file name of the object that defines the function
	str in object ob. The returned value can be other than
	file_name(ob) if the function is defined in an inherited
	object. In native mode, the returned name always begins with a
	'/' (absolute path). 0 is returned if the function was not
	defined, or was defined as static.
