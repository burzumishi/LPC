SYNOPSIS
	object to_object(string arg)
	object to_object(closure arg)
	object to_object(object arg)

DESCRIPTION
	The argument is converted into an object, if possible.
	For strings, the object with a matching file_name() is
	returned, or 0 if there is none, as find_object() does.
	For (bound!) closures, the object holding the closure is
	returned.
	Objects and the number 0 return themselves.

SEE ALSO
	find_object(E), to_array(E), to_int(E), to_string(E)
