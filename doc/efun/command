SYNOPSIS
	int command(string str)			/* native */
	int command(string str, object ob)	/* !native */

DESCRIPTION
	Execute str as a command given directly by the user. Any
	effects of the command will apply to the current object.
	
	Return value is 0 for failure. Otherwise a numeric value is
	returned which tells the evaluation cost. Bigger number means
	higher cost.  The evaluation cost is approximately the number
	of LPC machine code instructions executed.

	In native mode, command() can effect only the calling object.
	If native mode is not enabled, command() can get an optional
	second arg, that specifies the object that the command is to
	be applied to.
	If command() is called on another object, it is not possible
	to call static functions in this way, to give some protection
	against illegal forces.
