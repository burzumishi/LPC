SYNOPSIS
	void ed()
	void ed(string file)
	void ed(string file, string func)

DESCRIPTION
	Calling without arguments will start the editor ed with the
	name of the error file, that was returned by
	master->valid_read(0, geteuid(this_player()), "ed_start",
	this_player()), usually something like ~/.err. If that file is
	empty, ed will immediatly exit again.
	Calling ed() with argument file will start the editor on the
	file. If the optional argument func is given, this function
	will be called after exiting the editor.
	
	The editor ed is almost ed(1) compatible.

	enable_commands(E), query_editing(E), ed0(LPC)
