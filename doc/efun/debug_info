SYNOPSIS
	mixed debug_info(int flag, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
	Print out some driver internal debug information.

	If flag is 0, information like heart_beat, enable_commands
	etc. of the specified object will be printed, and 0 returned.

	If flag is 1, memory usage information like how many strings,
	variables, inherited files, object size etc. will be printed
	about the specified object, and 0 returned.

	If flag is 2, objects from the global object list are
	returned.  If the optional second arg is omitted, the first
	element (numbered 0) is returned. If the second arg is a
	number n, the n'th element of the object list returned. If the
	second arg is an object, it's successor in the object list is
	returned.

	Flag == 3 is equivalent to typing ``malloc'' at the command
	line. No second arg must be given. Returns 0.

	If flag is 4, the required second arg can be 0, "tables" or
	"swap" and has the same effect as ``status'', ``status
	tables'' resp. ``status swap'' on the command line. Returns 1
	if a valid argument was given, 0 otherwise.
