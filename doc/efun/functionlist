NAME
	mixed *functionlist(mixed ob, int flags)

SYNOPSIS
	functionlist() returns an array with information about an
	object's functions.

	The first arg is an object or a file_name.

	The second (optional) arg flags specifies, what info is to be
	returned (function names, or return types, or number of args
	the functions takes, ...), and also, if info is wanted about
	all functions, or just about public/private/varargs/...
	functions.  The interpreter source should contain a
	<mudlib/sys/lpctypes.h> and <mudlib/sys/functionlist.h> that
	define the values for the flags and the returntypes of
	functionlist().

	Currently (3.2.1@40) the following symbolic values for the
	flag are #defined, which can be ored together:

	RETURN_FUNCTION_NAME
	RETURN_FUNCTION_FLAGS
	RETURN_FUNCTION_TYPE
	RETURN_FUNCTION_NUMARG
	RETURN_FUNCTION_ARGTYPE	/* not implemented */

	Also, if flags has TYPE_MOD_PRIVATE in it, then private
	functions will not be shown. If flags has TYPE_MOD_STATIC in
	it, then both private and static functions will not be shown.
	If flags has TYPE_MOD_PROTECTED in it, then both static and
	protected functions will not be shown.
	If flags has NAME_HIDDEN in it, then functions which are
	private when inherited will not be shown.
