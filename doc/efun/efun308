SYNOPSIS
	void efun308(object item, object env)

DESCRIPTION
	The item is moved into its new environment env, which may be 0.
	This efun is to be used in the move_object() hook, as it does
	nothing else than moving the item - no calls to init() or such.

	Don't use it in your own objects!

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1@1

	Just in case somebody wonders what kind of names efun308 is:
	it isn't an efun name at all, but rather a makeshift
	because there is none yet; hopefully, with the existance of
	the efun (and maybe others), the issue of their naming will
	become a bit more interesting than what command shell was used
	on a room-filling dinosaur of a computer some decades ago.

	Hyp proposes to christen efun308() 'set_environment()'.
