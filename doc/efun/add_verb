SYNOPSIS
	void add_verb(string str)

DESCRIPTION
	This function is connected to the add_action() function. It
	will set up the command str to trigger a call to the function
	set up by the previous call to add_action().
	
	This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly
	with add_action(). add_verb() remains for compatibility.

	[marion Sun Jan 19 1992 Don't use it. This file is retained
	because of somewhat nostalgic reasons.]
