SYNOPSIS
	int send_erq(int request, string|int * data, closure callback)

DESCRIPTION
	A request of given type ('request', default is 0), equipped
	with the given 'data', is sent to the erq. If 'callback' is
	set to a closure, it will be called when the response from the
	erq arrives, if the response carries enough data to work on:
	  void <closure>(int * response_data, int len)

	The data given to send_erq() may be either a string, or an
	array of integers, which are then interpreted as characters.
	The various requests are defined in /sys/erq.h.

	The result returned is 0 on failure, or non-zero on success.

	The function causes a privilege violation "erq".

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1@61.
	Made a privileged function in 3.2.1@84
