mixed assoc(mixed key, mixed *keys, mixed *|void data_or_fail, mixed|void fail);

Searches a key in an alist.

Three modes of calling:
   i ) With exactly two arguments, the second being an array which's first
       element is no array.
       In this case the entire array is searched for the key; -1 is returned
	 if not found, else the index ( like member_array, but faster ).

   ii) With two or three arguments, the second being an array which's first
       element is an array.
       The array has to have a second element of the same size;
       the key is searched in the first and the associated element of the
       second array that is element of second argument is returned if succesful;
       if not, 0 is returned, or the third argument, if given.

   iii) With three or four arguments, the second being an array of keys
	( first element no array ) and the second is a matching data array.
	returns 0 or fourth argument ( if given ) for failure,
	or the matching entry in the array given as third argument for success.

Complexity : O( lg(n) ) , where n is the number of keys.

Return value is undefined if another list is given in place of a presorted
key list.
