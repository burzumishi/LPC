SYNOPSIS
	Compat:	void   snoop()
		void   snoop(object snoopee)
	Native:	object snoop(object snooper)
		object snoop(object snooper, object snoopee)

DESCRIPTION
	Compatibility Mode:

	When given w/o argument, any actual snoop is terminated,
	else a snoop on object 'snoopee' is started.

	If 'snoopee' is snooped already by someone else, or this snoop
	would result in a recursive snoop action, the snoop fails.
	The success is written to this_player(), but not returned as a
	result.

	Native Mode:

	Starts a snoop from 'snooper' on 'snoopee', or if 'snoopee' is not
	given, terminates any snoop from 'snooper'.
	On success, 'snoopee' is returned, else 0.

	The snoop is checked with the master object for validity.
	It will also fail if the 'snoopee' is being snooped already or
	if a snoop would result in a recursive snoop action. 
	Up to 3.2, the current object also has to have a non-zero uid.

HISTORY
	Since 3.2.1, the native mode description also applies for the
	compatibility mode, except for the checking of this_object()s uid.
