SYNOPSIS
	void set_connection_charset(int* bitvector, int quote_iac)

DESCRIPTION
	set the set of characters that can be output to the
	interactive user (this does not apply to binary_message() ) .
	bitvector is interpreted as an array of 8-bit-values and might
	contain up to 32 elements. Character n is allowed to be output
	if sizeof(bitvector) > n/8 && bitvector[n/8] & (1 << n%8) . 
	This affects the interactive struct of this_object(), if
	present. 
	If quote_iac is 0 and char 255 is allowed to be output,	IAC
	will be output unmodified.
	If quote_iac is 1 and char 255 is allowed to be output,
	char 255 will be quoted so that it is not interpreted as IAC
	by the telnet protocol.

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1@40
