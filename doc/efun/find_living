SYNOPSIS
	object find_living(string str)

DESCRIPTION
	Find the first "living" object in the table of livings, that
	has str as living name, set with set_living_name(). The the
	object to search for must also have called enable_commands().
	There is a special hash table that speeds up the search for
	such living objects (thus you cannot rely on the order of
	livings, if there are more than one with the same name).

EXAMPLE
	object ob;
	ob = find_living("Public Enenemy");

HISTORY
	Since 3.2.1@40, this is a simulated efun. The handling of
	living names is no longer part of the driver.

SEE ALSO
	find_player(E), enable_commands(E), set_living_name(E)
