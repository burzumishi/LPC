SYNOPSIS
	int restore_object(string name)

DESCRIPTION
	Restore values of variables for current object from file name.
	If name ends in ``.c'', this suffix is stripped of by the parser.

	The master object will probably append a .o to the name.
	
	Variables that has the type modifer 'static' will not be saved.
	Example: static int xxx;
	
	If inheritance is used, then it might be possible that a variable
	will exist with the same name in more than one place. When
	restoring, only one of these variables will be restored if
	encountered in the save file.
	A good practice is to have verbose and unique name on non-static
	variables, which also will make it more easy to read or patch the
	save file manually.
