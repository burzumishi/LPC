SYNOPSIS
	mixed *query_actions(object ob, mixed mask_or_verb)

DESCRIPTION
	query_actions takes either an object or a filename as first
	argument and a bitmask (int) or string as a second argument.
	If the second argument is a string, query_actions() will return
	an array containing information (see below) on the verb or
	zero if the living object "ob" cannot use the verb. If the
	second argument is a bitmask, query_actions() will return a
	flat array containing information on all verbs added to ob.
	The second argument is optional (default is the bitmask 1).
		1:  the verb
		2:  type
		4:  short_verb
		8:  object
		16: function

	"type" is one of the values defined in <sent.h> (/sys/sent.h)
	(which is provided with the parser source).
