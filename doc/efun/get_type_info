SYNOPSIS
	mixed get_type_info(mixed arg, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns info about the type of arg, as controlled by the flag.

	If the optional argument flag is not a number, an array is
	returned, whose first element is an integer denoting the data
	type, as defined in <lpctypes.h>. The second entry can contain
	additional information about arg.
	If flag is the number 0, only the first element of that array
	(i.e. the data type) is returned (as int). If flag is 1, the
	second element is returned. 
	If <arg> is a closure, the <flag> setting 2 lets the efun
	return the object the closure is bound to.
	For every other <flag> setting, -1 is returned.

	For mappings, the second entry is the width (i.e. number of
	data items per key).

	For closures, symbols and quoted arrays a the number of quotes
	is returned as additional info about arg.

	For all other data types, -1 is returned as additional info.

BUGS
	This function seems to be due to frequent changes as the
	driver develops resp. is debugged.

HISTORY
