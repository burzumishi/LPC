SYNOPSIS
	int attach_erq_demon(object ob, int do_close)
	int attach_erq_demon(string obname, int do_close)

DESCRIPTION
	This privileged efun is to set/change the connection of the
	driver to the external erq demon, thus in effect changing the
	demons.

	The connection of the given interactive 'ob'ject is taken away(!)
	from it and stored as the erq-connection. The object itself is
	then no longer needed, but may stay alive - it is just another
	non-interactive object then.

	In the second form, the string will be combined as suffix to
	the filename BINDIR/erq<obname>, which is then the binary to be
	forked off as new erq demon. The communication with this erq
	will take place over unix domain sockets.

	If there is alreay an erq demon connected to the driver, the
	function will fail unless 'do_close' (default 0) is specified
	as 1 (or any other odd integer): then the old connection will
	be closed before attaching the new.
	The efun returns 1 on success, else 0.

EXAMPLE
	To restart the (default) erq, write in
	master.c::stale_erq(closure c):
	  attach_erq_demon("", 0);

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1@61. Second invocation form since 3.2.1@97.
