SYNOPSIS
	int cat(string path, int start, int num)

DESCRIPTION
	List the file found at path.

	In most installations it is not legal to have '..' or spaces
	in the path. This commands is normally connected to the "cat"
	command that wizards have. It is also used by the "help"
	command. The optional arguments start and num are start line
	number and number of lines. If they are not given the whole
	file is printed from the beginning.
	
	The total number of lines will not exceed a system limit, which
	normally is 50 lines.
	
	cat() returns the number of lines read and printed if success,
	0 if no such file or no lines to read (if start or len is < 0,
	or if the file has less than start lines).

EXAMPLE
	cat("/doc/efun/cat", 5, 9);
	
	This will print out the file "/doc/efun/cat" begining at line
	5 and ending with line 13.
