SYNOPSIS
	int mapping_contains(mixed &data1, ..., &dataN, map, key)

DESCRIPTION
	If the mapping contains the key map, the corresponding values
	are assigned to the data arguments, which massed be passed by
	reference, and 1 is returned. If key is not in map, 0 is
	returned and the data args are left unchanged.
	It is possible to use this function for a 0-value mapping, in
	which case it has the same effect as member(E).

SEE ALSO
	mappings(LPC), member(E)
