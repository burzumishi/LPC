SYNOPSIS
	int binary_message(int *|string message, int flags)

DESCRIPTION
	Flush output and send output directly with write WITHOUT IAC QUOTING.
	The message may contain zeroes if given as int *.
	The messages goes to this_object(), but only if interactive.
	return value: number of characters actually written.
	Any 'allowed charset' setting is ignored.

	Flag settings are interpreted bitwise and may be ored
	together:

	  Bit 0 (value 1): when set, add_message() is used instead of
	    write(). Thus no previous flushing of the buffer is
	    needed, but the output is not immediate, nor can the
	    number of bytes actualle sent be determined - the return
	    value is undefined.
	  Bit 1 (value 2): The buffer is flushed _after_ adding the
	    message. Useful only in conjunction with Bit 0.

	The idea behind the flag settings is that sending command
	codes for colours and other things needs to bypass the allowed
	charset filters, but isn't important enough to waste bandwith
	on a synchronous trasmission.

HISTORY
	Introduced in 3.2.1@40.
