SYNOPSIS
	mixed * get_error_file(string name, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
	Return information about the last error which occured for
	<name> (where <name> is a valid name from the wiz list).
	Result is an array of four elements: the filename of the
	program where the error occured, the linenumber in the
	program, the error message (runtime error messages usually
	start with a '*'), and a numerical flag (the 'forget flag') if
	the error information has been queried already.
	If there is no error stored for the given <name>, 0 is
	returned.

	After querying the error information, the forget flag is set,
	unless a 0 has been passed as <flag> argument to the efun.
