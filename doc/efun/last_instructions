SYNOPSIS
	string *last_instructions (int length, int verbose)

DESCRIPTION

	Return an array showing the 'length' last executed
	instructions in disassembled form. If 'verbose' is non-zero
	(the default), line number information are also included.
	Each string is built as this:

	  Opcode-Address: Opcode Operand Mnemonic (Stackdepth) Linenumber

	The linenumber information is appended if requested and a new
	source line is reached. Also, calls between objects produce a

	  Objectname Programname Linenumber

	entry in the resulting array (in verbose mode only).

	There is a preconfigured upper limit for the backtrace.
