SYNOPSIS
	void set_auto_include_string(string arg)

DESCRIPTION

	The arg will be automatically included into every compiled LPC
	object. This is useful to enforce global definitions, e.g.
	``#pragma combine_strings'' or ``#pragma strict_types''.  The
	calling object needs to be privileged by the master object.

	Note that the auto-include-string is cleared when the master
	object is reloaded.

SEE ALSO
	privilege_violation(M), pragma(LPC), master(M)
