SYNOPSIS
	void raise_error(string arg)

DESCRIPTION
	Abort execution. If the current program execution was
	initiated by catch(), that catch expression will return arg as
	error code, else the arg will printed as error message.	 This
	is very similar to throw(), but while throw() is intended to
	be called inside catch(), raise_error() can be called
	anywhere.

SEE ALSO
	catch(E), throw(E)
