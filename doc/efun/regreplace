SYNOPSIS
	string regreplace(string txt, string pattern, string replacepattern, int flags)

DESCRIPTION
	This function looks through txt looking for the regular
	expression pattern. If it finds it, it replaces it by the
	replacepattern. The flag is a bitmask, where bit 0 specifies
	that the search and replace should repeat as often as the
	pattern matches, and bit 1 (mask 2) specifies if the regular
	expressions are 'ex' compatible or not. The function returns
	the modified string (or the original if it wasn't modified).

	The function behaves like the s/pattern/replacepattern/flags
	in editors as ed/vi or sed. The power of this function lies in
	replacing variable strings (as opposed to regexplode, where
	you can explode by regular expression, but not implode...)

EXAMPLE
	string msgin;

	/* Checks msgin for the string 'tells you: ' and all following
	 * characters and encloses those characters by <underline>
         * and </underline>. global.
	 */
	msgin = regreplace(msgin, "tells you: (.*)",
		 "tells you: <underline>\\1</underline>", 1);
	
	/* replaces all <underline> html tags by the vt100 escape
	 * sequence for underline.
	 */
	txt = regreplace(txt, "<underline>", "<ESC>[5m", 1);
