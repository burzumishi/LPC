SYNOPSIS
	void tell_object(object ob, string str)

DESCRIPTION
	Send a message str to object ob. If it is an interactive
	object (a user), and it does not define catch_tell(), then
	the message will go to him (her?), otherwise the lfun
	catch_tell() of the living will be called with the message as
	argument.

EXAMPLES
	object who;
	who=find_player("deepthought");
	tell_object(who, "Hi!\n");
	
	Just tell Deepthought a simple "Hi!".
	
	
	Object 1 (living with the name "dummymonster"):
	   void catch_tell(string str) {
	      write("Received: "+str+"\n");
	   }
	Object 2:
	   void func() {
	      object who;
	      who=find_living("dummymonster");
	      tell_object(who, "Follow me, mortal one!\n");
	      ...
	   }
	
	This examples shows how tell_object() together with
	catch_tell() works.
