SYNOPSIS
	string read_bytes(string file, int start, int number)

DESCRIPTION
	Reads a given amount of bytes from file.
	If <start> is not given or 0, the file is read from the
	beginning, else from the <start>th byte on. If <start> is
	negative, it is counted from the end of the file.
	<number> is the number of bytes to read. 0 or negative values
	are possible, but not useful.
	If <start> would be outside the actual size of the file, 0 is
	returned instead of a string.
