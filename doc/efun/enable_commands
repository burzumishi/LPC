SYNOPSIS
	void enable_commands()

DESCRIPTION
	Enable this object to use commands normally accessible to
	users. This also marks the current object as "living".
	
	Avoid to call this function from other places then from inside
	create() (or reset(0) in compat mode), because the command
	giver will be set to this object.

EXAMPLE
	void create() {
	   enable_commands();
	   set_living_name("dummymonster");
	}
	
	This will make the current object a living object which then
	can be accessed via find_living("dummymonster").

SEE ALSO
	command(E), living(E), disable_commands(E), native(C), hook(C)
