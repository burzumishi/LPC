SYNOPSIS
	int member_array(mixed item, mixed *arr)
	int member_array(mixed item, string arr)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns the index of the first occurence of item in array arr,
	or occurence of a character in a string. If not found, then -1
	is returned.
	
	If you want to search through an alist, use assoc() because
	member_array() is good for unsorted but assoc() is faster for
	sorted arrays.

SEE ALSO
	alists(LPC), mappings(LPC), assoc(E), slice_array(E)
