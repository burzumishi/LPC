SYNOPSIS
	string traceprefix(string prefix)
	string traceprefix(int dummy)

DESCRIPTION
	If called with a string, only objects matching this prefix will
	be traced. The string must not contain a leading "/" because
	the object names are stored internally without it. If called
	with a number, the traceprefix will be ignored and all objects
	will be traced. Returns the last traceprefix or 0 if there
	wasn't any.

	The master-lfun query_player_level() is called to verify the
	usage of this efun.

EXAMPLE
	object obj;
	string prefix;
	obj = find_player("deepthought");
	prefix = file_name(obj);
	prefix = prefix[1..strlen(prefix)-1]; /* cut off the leading "/" */
	traceprefix(prefix);
	  /* From here on, only code in the object "std/player#69"
	   * will be traced.
           */
	trace(1|2|4|8);
	...
	trace(0);
