SYNOPSIS
	string clear_bit(string str, int n)

DESCRIPTION
	Return the new string where bit n is cleared in string str.
	Note that the old string str is not modified.
	
	Each character contains 6 bits. So you can store a value
	between 0 and 63 ( 2^6=64) in one character. Starting
	character is the blank character " " which has the value 0.
	The first charcter in the string is the one with the lowest
	bits (0-5).

EXAMPLES
	string s;
	s=clear_bit("_",5);
	
	Because "_" is the highest possible value (63), the variable s
	will now contain the charcter "?" wich is equal to 31
	(63-2^5=31).
	
	string s;
	s=clear_bit("?<",3);
	s=clear_bit(s,8);
	
	s will now contain the string "78". "?" equals 31 and "<"
	equals 28. Now "?<" is equal to 31+28<<6=31+1792=1823 which is
	in binary notation (highest bit on the right side)
	11111000111. Now clearing the bit 3 and bit 8 (bit numbering
	starts with zero) will result in 11101000011. The first 6 bits
	are in decimal notation 23 and the next 6 are equal to 24. Now
	the 23 is the character "7" and 24 is the "8". So the string s
	contains "78".
