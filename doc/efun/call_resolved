SYNOPSIS
	int call_resolved(mixed result, object ob, string func, ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Similar to call_other(). If ob->func() is defined and publicly
	accessible, any of the optional extra arguments are passed to
	ob->func(...). The result of that function call is stored in
	result, which must be passed by reference.

	If the current object is already destructed, or the ob does
	not exist, or ob does not define a public accessible function
	named func, call_resolved() returns 0 as failure code, else 1
	for success.

	ob can also be a file_name. If a string is passed for ob, and
	no object with that name does exist, an error occurs.
