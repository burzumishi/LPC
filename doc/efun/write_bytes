SYNOPSIS
	int write_bytes(string file, int start, string str)

DESCRIPTION
	Write string str to file file by overwriting the old bytes at
	position start. If start is a negative value then it will be
	counted from the end of the file. The file will not be
	appended, instead the function will be aborted. Returns 1 for
	success 0 for failure during execution.

	Note: since version 3.2@232, write_bytes() is able to append
	to the file.
