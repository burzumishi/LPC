SYNOPSIS
	object first_inventory()
	object first_inventory(string ob)
	object first_inventory(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Get the first object in the inventory of ob, where ob is
	either an object or the file name of an object. If ob is not
	given, the current object is assumed.

EXAMPLES
	This efun is mostly used in the following context:
	
	for(ob=first_inventory(container);ob;ob=next_inventory(ob)) {
	   <some actions>
	}
	
	If you use such calls frequently then it would be very useful
	to use a preprocessor macro:
	
	#define FORALL(x, y) for(x=first_inventory(y);x;x=next_inventory(x))
	
	So the above example could be written like this:
	
	FORALL(ob, container) {
	   <some actions>
	}
	
	Warning: If the object ob is moved inside <some actions>, then
	next_inventory() will return an object from the new inventory
	of ob. You also shouldn't call next_inventory() on destructed
	objects. So in case of move and/or destruction the following
	is a better solution: 
	
	for(ob=first_inventory(container);ob;) {
	   next=next_inventory(ob);
	   <some actions and moves and/or removes>
	   ob=next;
	}
