CONCEPT
	files

DESCRIPTION
	As a wizard, you are working with files. Each file represents
	the bulding plan for one or more objects (except text or doc files
	of course).

	The mudlib has a root, and when working with filenames, you
	can always specify a full pathname from the root by starting
	with a '/' (slash) at the beginning of the file name.

	(oops, truncated - why when where did it happen?)

SEE ALSO
	objects(C), create(A), reset(A)
