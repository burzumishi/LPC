DESRIPTION
	Here we should write down the basics about objects.

	Since 3.2.1@94, objects can have more than 256 global variables.
	Since 3.2.1@117, inherited functions may be specified by
	wildcards '*' and '?'. Example:

	  inherit "foo";
	  inherit "bar";
	  inherit "baz";
	  inherit "ball";

	  reset() {
	    "ba?"::reset();
	    // calls bar::reset() and baz::reset()

	    "ba*"::reset();
	    // calls bar::reset(), baz::reset() and ball::reset()

	    "*"::reset();
	    // calls every inherited reset() function.
	  }
