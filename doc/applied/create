SYNOPSIS
	void create()

DESCRIPTION
	In native mode, this function will be called only once on
	creation of the object (this is when the object will be loaded
	or cloned). Inside this function all major initialization can
	be done. The current user and the previous object are
	defined but the object has no environment.

EXAMPLE
	object cloner;
	void create() {
	   cloner=this_player();
	}
	
	Initialize the global variable to hold the one who
	created/cloned the object.

	For 3.2.1, the mudlib may be programmed to call other lfuns
	than create() on an objects creation.
