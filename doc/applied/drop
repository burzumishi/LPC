SYNOPSIS
	int drop(void)
	int drop(int silently)

DESCRIPTION
	In compat mode this lfun is used by the efun transfer().

	It is called to check if an object wants to be moved out of
	the inventory of a living object. drop() should return 1 to
	prevent dropping. This is the opposite of the get() function.
	That is because if drop() is not defined, it will always be
	possible to drop an object.

	If the object self-destructs when drop() is called, be sure to
	return 1, as the destructed item surely not can be dropped.

	Most compat mode LPC libraries to define one argument for
	drop. If silently is true, no messages should be written.
