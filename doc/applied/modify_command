SYNOPSIS
	int|string modify_command(string cmd)

DESCRIPTION
	After set_modify_command(mob) was called for an interactive
	object iob, all commands for that user will be passed to
	mob->modify_command(), and the return will then be checked for
	actions.

	If the result is a string, it is the new command to execute
	instead of the given one. Note that it is not possible to
	make several commands from one this way!
	If the result is a non-zero number, the given command is to
	be ignored. In case of the closure/lfun setting this may
	mean that the closure/lfun already executed it.
	If the result is 0, the originally given command is to be
	used.

HISTORY
	In 3.2.1@109 the name of the lfun to call must be specified
	using the H_MODIFY_COMMAND_FNAME driver hook.
	'modify_command' in the above text is therefore to read as
	placeholder for the real name.
