SYNOPSIS
	int get()

DESRIPTION
	In compat mode, this function is used by the efun transfer().

	If an object wants control over when it is possible to pick it
	up, i.e. moved into a living object, then it must define
	get(), and return 1 if ok to pick up.

	id() has been called before this to identify the object.

SEE ALSO
	transfer(E), drop(A)
