SYNOPSIS
	string query_real_name(void)

DESCRIPTION
	The result of this_player()->query_real_name() is used as
	default argument for the efun wizlist().

	If LOG_SHOUT was #defined in the parser at compile time, the
	efun shout will use query_real_name() to log the shouter's
	name.

HISTORY
	Since 3.2.1, the wizlist() efun is implemented on mudlib level and
	thus this function may not be longer mandatory for a given mudlib.

	shout(E), wizlist(E)
