SYNOPSIS
	int remove(void)

DESCRIPTION
	remove() does some housekeeping to ensure consistency and then
	destruct the current object.

	This lfun is not applied by the parser, but by other objects
	to tell the current object to self-destruct. remove() should
	be supplied by the base classes of the library.  Return 1 if
	actually self-destructed, 0 otherwise.

NOTE
	Your actual mudlib may name this lfun differently, "remove" is
	just the traditional name.

SEE ALSO
	destruct(E)
