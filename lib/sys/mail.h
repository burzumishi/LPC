 * The format of the personal mail-files is as follows:
 * filename: /players/mail/{first-letter}/{playername}.o
 *
 * (mixed)   player_mail
 *              ({ ([ "from"  : (string)  message_from,
 *                    "subj"  : (string)  message_subject,
 *                    "date"  : (int)     message_date == time(),
 *                    "read"  : (int)     message_read,
 *                    "length": (string)  message_length,
 *                    "reply" : (int)     message_is_reply
 *                 ]),  ....
 *              })

 * (mapping) player_aliasses
 *              ([ "alias" : ({ alias_names }), ...
 *              ])
 *
 * (int)     player_new_mail
 * (int)     player_automatic_cc
 *
 * Using the efuns restore_map() and save_map(), we can save the players
 * message file as it were a mapping:
 *
 * ([ "mail"     : (mixed)   player_mail,
 *    "aliases"  : (mapping) player_aliasses,
 *    "new_mail" : (int)     player_new_mail,
 *    "autocc"   : (int)     player_automatic_cc
 * ])
 *
 * The message-files are formatted like:
 * filename: /players/messages/d{message-date % HASH_SIZE}/m{message-date}.o
 * In this, the directories are named d0 - d[HASH_SIZE-1].
 *
 * ([ "to"       : (string)  message_to,
 *    "cc"       : (string)  message_cc,
 *    "address"  : (string)  message_addressees,
 *    "body"     : (string)  message_body
 * ])
 *
 * Alias_names, message_to, message_cc and message_addressees are a
 * single string with the (player-)names, separated by commas.
 * The names in message_from, message_to and message_cc and
 * message_addressees are capitalized, where player_aliases is in
 * lower case.

/*
 * IS_MAIL_ALIAS(a)
 *
 * This returns true if a global mail alias with the name 'a' exists and
 * false if no such global alias exists.

#define IS_MAIL_ALIAS(a)     (file_size(ALIAS_DIR + (a)) > 0)

/*
 * EXPAND_MAIL_ALIAS(a)
 *
 * This returns an array of all player-names (in lower case) that are
 * in the global mail alias 'a'. Notice that you _must_ check whether the
 * alias exists before you use this alias. You can use IS_MAIL_ALIAS(a)
 * for that. If you use this macro and the alias does not exist, you are
 * bound to get a runtime error.

/*
 * CREATE_MAIL(subject, author, to, cc, body)
 *
 * This macro allows you to have mail messages generated and sent from code.
 * The arguments are as follows:
 *   subject - The subject of the note, maximum length of 35 characters
 *   author  - The lower case name of the alleged author of the note. Can
 *             be any name (string) of between 2 and 11 characters.
 *   to      - A comma-separated lower case string of names to receive the
 *             message.
 *   cc      - A comma-separated lower case string of names to receive a
 *             carbon copy of the message, or "" for no CC recipients.
 *   body    - The body text of the message. Lines should be separated with
 *             newlines, and a trailing newline is not necessary. The body
 *             text is automatically prepended with a line saying that this
 *             mail message is automatically generated.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the author of the code to make sure that the
 * strings for 'to' and 'cc' only contain valid player names. Else, the mail
 * will not be sent.
 *
 * Misuse of this macro, by impersonating another person, or otherwise, be it
 * seriously or as joke will be punished by demotion, deletion or worse.
 *
 * Returns: 1 if the mail is succesfully sent.
