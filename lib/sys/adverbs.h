/*
 * /sys/adverbs.h
 *
 * This file will allow you to handle adverbs that are known in the mudlib.
 * If you specify an adverb you only need to supply a part of that adverb.
 * The pattern should be at least three characters long and the first adverb
 * that matches the first sizeof(pattern) characters will be returned as
 * recognized adverb.
 *
 * The adverbs themselves I stripped from the soul /cmd/std/soul_cmd.c and
 * if you want to use adverbs in a soul, you should use the functions
 * parse_adverb() and parse_adverb_with_space() that are both in the object
 * /cmd/std/command_driver.c, which is mandatory for souls anyway.
