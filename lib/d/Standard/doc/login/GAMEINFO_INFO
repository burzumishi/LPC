    A mud game can take many forms. However, common between all muds' is
    the fact that many people are able to interact within the game at the
    same time. MUD is the acronym for Multi User Dungeon. As the name
    implies, the first muds was set in a fantasy environment. Even though
    many still are, it is far from the only environment possible. What kind
    of world you play in is entirely up to the administrators of the game
    to decide. It can be anything from a science fiction universe in the
    far future to a medieval world with castles and dungeons. This particular
    world, Genesis, is set in a medieval fantasy environment.

    You play the role of an adventurer. As you explore the world you will
    meet other adventurers who might be friendly (or unfriendly) to you.
    It will be up to you to choose your friends and enemies. As you treat
    others, they are likely to treat you. Some creatures may prove hard to
    deal with and some might be willing to trade. A few will flee as you
    approach while others will stay and fight. As you gain experience as an
    adventurer you will get better at the skills that you choose to practise.
    Whether that is to wield powerful magic or lethal swords is again your
    choice. Maybe you wish to do both...

2. HISTORY.

END OF WARNING

    Earlier there were many different kinds of mud versions. The old mud
    games have made way for newer versions with new features but the idea
    is still the same. You roamed the world looking for treasures to find
    and monsters to slay. When you gained experience you advanced in level
    until you finally made it to Wizard level where you were immortal.
    Unfortunately the old muds had a major fault. You were not able to
    affect the world in any major ways. Some muds allowed you to add
    descriptions but designing new adventures and to expand the world
    was restricted to the administrator.

    Then there was new light. A guy named Lars Pensj| designed a new
    version of mud and called it LPmud. It was early spring 1990.
    Every item and object was now defined by a piece of C code. If you
    wished to make a change, that specific code were edited. Players
    who finally reached the desired wizard level was given the ability
    to code and make changes. Suddenly the game began to grow. Wizards
    designed their own castles and filled the dungeons with monsters,
    quests and treasures.

    A new world was created. The first of its kind.  Genesis.

    After a while some things were made quite clear. Not everyone is an
    ideal designer. Some wizards created enormous treasure hoards guarded
    by a whimpy monster just to attract the players to HIS castle. Others
    were making vast empty areas which wasn't very much fun to play in.
    Again something had to be done...
    The light above the inventors head grew brighter and some new rules
    were adapted. The wizards now had to join in domains supported by a
    domain lord. Each domain were to work towards a specific goal and the
    lord was responsible to the Gods if the wizards showed bad judgement.
    With the Gods overseeing their followers work, things got more
    organized and Genesis was cleaned up.

    In the summer of '91 we were about to make a new great change of
    the game. Things that we had learned to be bad were removed or
    improved. Features that had been missed were added. The changes was
    so profound that it again became a new LPmud version. People were
    coding like crazy during the summer and made good progress.
    Today we have the game running an beta version.

    However, a large number of other LPmud games (other worlds) has popped
    up here and there. The earlier LPmud versions has been exported to
    sites near and far. The game has grown to be quite popular and we are
    proud to be able to say that Genesis is the original.

3. GETTING STARTED.

WARNING!!! THIS TEXT HAS TO BE CHANGED BY EACH MUD ADMINISTRATOR. THIS TEXT
           ONLY SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN USE gameinfo TO GIVE

END OF WARNING
    Since you have gotten this far I assume you know how to connect to
    Genesis. What you need to do in order to be able to play the game is
    to create a player character. Your adventurer.

    [name]
    First you get a question where you are asked to type your name.
    (That was where you typed 'gameinfo' to get this stupid text...)
    Be advised that the name you enter there is the name of your
    adventurer in the game. The name you choose is for you to keep
    all through the game and it can not be changed.

    [password]
    When you have chosen a name you will be asked to enter a password.
    This password is for you to know and none to find out. It prevents
    others from playing your character and thus imposing as you.
    The password has to be at least 6 characters long and will not be
    echoed on your screen as you type it. You will have to confirm it
    by typing it a second time.

    [E-mail address]
    Now you will be asked to enter your E-mail address if you have one.
    It enables us to get in contact with you if the need should arise.
    If you don't have one, just enter 'none'. This can be changed later.

    [race]
    Then it is time for you to choose what race your character should be.
    You may choose between:  Human and Vogon.
    They all have different skills and they start on different locations
    in the world.

    [weight/volume]
    Here is a funny one. You are asked to determine what your player look
    like. Is it a very skinny, skinny, normal, fat or very fat player.
    It might seem corny but there are situations when that information
    will be useful.

    Having done all this, your character will be created.

4. HOW TO GET AROUND IN THE GAME.

END OF WARNING
    When you enter the world, things might seem strange to you at first
    sight. However, there are a lot of different commands intended to
    make things easier for you. Here is a short list of some useful ones.

      [north east west south up down]  [n e w s u d]
      These are the six basic directions for you to move in.
      If you wish to go north, type "north" or "n" to move that way.

      [look]  [look at]  [examine]
      By typing "look" you look around in your present location.
      If you "look at apple" you will take a closer look at the apple
      and resieve a longer description if that item. "examine" or "exa"
      will perform the same way.  This is a very useful command!

      [get] [drop]  [get all] [drop all]
      These commands allows you to pick up things that you find. You can
      of course drop the things you carry along with you as well.

      [inventory] [i]
      Allows you to see what you are carrying. If you carry a bag, you will
      have to type "look in bag" to see what is in it.

      [say] [shout]
      This is very very useful if you wish to talk to someone. Just type
      "say Hello, who are you?" when there is someone to talk to. If you
      shout you will be heard in the next room as well but not further away.

      [wield]  [kill]
      This might be useful if you are attacked...   Assume you are about
      to be eaten by a lion and can't run away. Well, you can fight by
      wielding a weapon ("wield sword") and kill the lion ("kill lion").
      But then, the lion might kill you anyway.

      [wear] [remove]
      If you have some sort of armor and wish to use it, you will have
      to wear it first. If you wish to change armor you must remove
      your old one. (remove leather armor)  (wear platemail)

      [introduce]
      When you meet someone in the game you do not instinctively know
      their name. Naturally you have to introduce yourself and your
      fellow companions to the new person.  Example: Gubgub the gnome
      and Bergabur the dwarf meets a tall handsome human wizard.
      Gubgub bows to the wizard and introduces himself. (introduce myself)
      He then introduces Bergabur to the wizard. (introduce Bergabur)
      The human wizard bows to them and introduces himself as
      Lord Styles - Ruler of Liwitch Island, male human (devious).

END OF WARNING
    Well, basically this is a game so the main goal should be to have fun.
    In reality there are as many definitions of 'having fun' as there are
    people to ask. Some like to explore and kill monsters. Some like to
    solve quests and riddles. Others prefer to just meet people and talk
    while some crave for power and domination. However, there are always
    people who enjoy making life miserable for others...
