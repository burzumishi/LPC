                               Hordelands...                               
                        A summarization of a land...                       
                                                                           
   The Sages of Faerun call it the Endless Waste. The mandarins
of Kara-Tur know it as the Plain of Horses. The wizers of Durpar
know it as Al-Tirmaq. It is a land of many names and many places.
Solon, Ra-Khati, Semphar, Khazari, the Northern Desert and the 
Land of Snow Demons; it is a nameless wasteland, a vast expanse
of emptiness. It is a land well-known to its travellers and yet
a mystery to all outsiders. There are no cities, no great capitals,
yet legions beyond number march in great armies. The rulers print
money, have their own writing, and obey written laws, yet live
lives of nomadic barbarism, travelling across the steppe and 
desert from oasis to oasis. It is a poor, penniless land, yet the
greatest eiches of the world travel accross it's paths. It is a 
land of contridictions...

   A great sage wrote this, he too was a traveller, a great one.
