                               an evil race.                               
                                                                           
The most evil race to walk this world are known as the Draconians,
their evil deeds knows no limits. These creatures appears in many
different forms, all with their own special powers. STOP reading
now if you want to learn this by yourself! CONTINUE if you value
your life. Here follows a brief presentation of them:

* Narrowfaced Draconians = these Draconians are the weakest kind,
they will turn into stone when defeated, so watch your weapons!
* Meanfaced Draconians = fighting these can prove fatal to young
fighters as they turn into hazardous acid when fallen.
* Broadfaced Draconians = be cautious when challenging these since
they are both good fighters and uses powerful magic, beware of
the lethal way these Draconians perish, or so will you.
* Uglyfaced Draconians = only really strong travellers should
confront these Draconians as they are both terribly strong and
are one with the fire, extra caution should be taken in the plains.
* Evilfaced Draconians = this is the strongest kind and also the most
dangerous, needless to say only experienced daredevils should try.
Beware as the lightning strikes when these demonic creatures
meets their maker, or you may meet your.

Please help us to get rid of these foul creatures, for they have
now infested many parts of this world. They have several strongholds.
A good place to start might be Neraka, to which you can travel via Solace,

bolder adventurers might try the Plains of Palanthas and its surroundings.
There are some rumours flowing about an evil fortress south of Solace,
but as few has ever come back from there alive, this remains unknown.
