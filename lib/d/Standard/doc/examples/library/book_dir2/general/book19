                                   Thanar                                  
                 The true story of the Holy Order of Thanar                
                                                                           
It was with much sorrow that I read the reports of Milashk, a misguided traveller who has obviously not kept his wits about him in his travels.  Milashk writes of the newly discovered land of Kalad, a place of excitement and adventure.  Milashk goes on to talk about the decadent city of Kabal, and the Holy Order of Thanar.  Unfortunatly, Milashk knows not of what he talks, and has maligned this most sacred of Orders most terribly.

It falls to me to set the story straight, and to let my fellow travellers know of this great Order, of like-minded humans.  As you would all be aware, this world through which we travel is infested with humanoids - the so-called races of Faeries, Halflings, Gobbos, Squats and Gnomes.  In reality, these are not races, but are corrupted and deviant humans, who have let themselves sink into the chaos that surrounds this world.

There is one group of humans who have stayed true to the ideals of Humanity, and have formed an order, the Holy Order of Thanar.  This Order worships the greatest God of Kalad, Thanar the Pure, worshipping Thanar above all other gods of Kalad.  The honourable followers of Thanar seek to further his name wherever they can, and seek to help the humanoids to regain their humanity.

Milashk talks about the Order as being a group of thieves, but this is because he has fallen under the spell of the corrupted citizens and demi-humans of Kabal, and has believed their foul lies.  Believe not what Milashk tells you, O Travellers, but join me as a member of the most Holy Order of Thanar, and we shall further the aims of our guild, and help those who are unfortunate not to be humans at the same time!
