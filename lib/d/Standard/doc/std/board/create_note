 *                few restrictions to the note:

 *                  same as the euid of the board;

 *                  in the game, mortal or wizard.
 *                In addition to that, you should ensure that the note is
 *                properly formatted and that it has newlines inserted at
 *                regular intervals, preferably before the 80th char/line.

 *                string author - the alleged author of the note  (max: 11)
 *                string body   - the note itself.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - success/failure.
