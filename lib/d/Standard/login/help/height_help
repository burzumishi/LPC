HELP FOR THE FIRST HALL OF MIRRORS

This part is pretty simple. Before you stand a number of mirrors, each
curved to make you look normal, taller or shorter, to varying degrees.
You can 'examine mirrors' to see all the possibilites at once, or examine
them one at a time, 'examine first mirror' or 'examine sixth mirror', for
example.

Once you've decided on the height you'd like (relative to your race, a
very tall dwarf isn't necessarily taller than a short human, for instance),
simply enter the appropriate mirror and be on your way.

Say for example you've examined the mirrors and decided you wanted to be
extremely short. You've figured out which mirror you want to enter probably
by double checking by 'examine first mirror' to be sure that it's the mirror
which makes you appear extremely short. Now, simply 'enter first mirror' and
poof, you'll be very short, and in the second hall of mirrors where you'll
then perform a similar event to set your width.

As a final breakdown, there are only three commands needed here:
'examine mirrors'          - See all the possibilities at once.
'examine <which> mirror'   - Examine a specific mirror.
'enter <which> mirror'     - Choose a height and move to next room.

Note that 'exa' and 'look at' will function identically to 'examine', and
the <which> option is one of the mirrors, i.e. first, second, third, etc.
