HELP ON THE HALL OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE

This room is provided for new players to pick up some initial skills to
begin their life as a player of Genesis. You are given a small amount of
money when you first arrive here to help with this, as skills cost money
here.

The skills available here are fairly varied, many are found in different
places called 'adventurer guilds' scattered across Genesis, however the
normal adventurer guilds don't offer as many, so you might have to look
awhile to find some of these skills, and others might not be available at
all. Skills like 'sword', 'knife', 'climb', 'swim', etc., are usually
not too hard to find, and almost every other adv. guild you find will
train one or more of these skills.

Basically what you do here, is 'learn' or 'improve' skills if you want to.
There are help pages on each of these commands ('help learn' and 'help
improve') which you might want to read.

Now, you don't have to spend all of the funds or even any of it here if
you don't want to. If you prefer to wait until you've gotten a little more
knowledge about which skills are best for a beginner, you can leave right
now without spending a coin, and improve them in the normal adventurer
guilds.

While it's true that some of the skills offered here may be difficult or
impossible to find in a normal adventurer guild, they are usually the
more obscure skills of little use to a novice.

WARNING: This is the point of no return. You can _never_ return to this
room. Exits are provided to return to the various points in the creation
process (to get a new body, new height/weight or new features). However,
if you go back to them from here, you won't be able to get back in here.
You'll enter the game itself from the features room. Also, if you choose
to leave by the 'south' exit here, you'll enter the game, and be unable
to return to this sequence.

We hope this helps, good luck in your new life.
