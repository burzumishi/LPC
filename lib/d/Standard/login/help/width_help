HELP FOR THE SECOND HALL OF MIRRORS (WIDTH)

If you've come this far, you won't have any problems here, since it works
pretty much the same as the height-setting room, except here you set width.
You can 'examine mirrors' to see all the possibilites at once, or examine
them one at a time, 'examine first mirror' or 'examine sixth mirror', for
example.

Once you've decided on the width you'd like (relative to your race, a
very fat elf isn't necessarily wider than a normal dwarf, for instance),
simply enter the appropriate mirror and be on your way.

Say for example you've examined the mirrors and decided you wanted to be
very skinny. You've figured out which mirror you want to enter probably
by double checking by 'examine first mirror' to be sure that it's the mirror
which makes you appear very skinny. Now, simply 'enter first mirror' and
poof, you'll be very skinny, and in the second hall of mirrors where you'll
then perform a similar event to set your width.

As a final breakdown, there are only three commands needed here:
'examine mirrors'          - See all the possibilities at once.
'examine <which> mirror'   - Examine a specific mirror.
'enter <which> mirror'     - Choose a width and move to next room.

Note that 'exa' and 'look at' will function identically to 'examine', and
the <which> option is one of the mirrors, i.e. first, second, third, etc.
