NAME
	Armageddon - not a command, just information.

DESCRIPTION
	From time to time, Armageddon will show up to shut the game down.
	The reason for this is usually that the host computer runs out
	of memory, but there can be other reasons too.

	What basically happens is that the game is closed down and that
	everyone is forced to quit, though you can naturally connect again
	if the game has been rebooted. This usually takes a few minutes,
	though it is better to wait five minutes and give Armageddon a
	chance to clean out some things before he boots the game again.

	When Armageddon shows up, you can ask him to teleport you to your
	starting location, so you may sell your equipment if you want
	that. Several of the items you carry may not survive the reboot.
