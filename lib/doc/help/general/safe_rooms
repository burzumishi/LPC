NAME
	safe_rooms - concept of Safe Rooms

DESCRIPTION

	This isn't a command, simply information.
	
	In general the concept of safe rooms, i.e. the rooms where you
	cannot fight is very consistent throughout Genesis - there are
	no such rooms. The following exceptions exist:

	* Inside guilds rooms where your enemies cannot reach
	  you. Mind you, if members of your guilds may fight between
	  themselves you aren't safe even there.

	* Common Board Rooms. In these rooms you cannot be attacked or
	  cannot attack. It doesn't matter if the attack is physical or
	  via spell. That means, if you logged in and want to read
	  common board messages, you will be allowed to do it
	  safely. However, Common Board Rooms are NO safe havens for
	  fleeing from fight. The fights that are already going on may
	  continue in Common Board Rooms, depending whether you managed
	  to break away far enough from the pursuers for the actual
	  fight to stop! 

	* Lone rooms throughout the Donut where fighting was
	  disabled similarly to Common Board Room. Their state is
	  precisely like the Common Board Room, you cannot rely on
	  them as a refuge for fleeing.

	If you are attacked for the first time inside a Common Board
	Room, please report that immediately to the AoP, including the
	log of how the fight was initiated. 
	
	If you encounter a room that forces you to stop fighting, and
	you consider it to be completely unjustified, or abusive,
	please contact the AoP team.

	If you think that a room is being "safe" alike to Common Board
	Room without proper justification, you're welcome to submit
	your opinion to the domain wizards.
