This is the bill of players' rights:

                     PARAGRAPH 1
Every player has the right to be a frog.

                     PARAGRAPH 2
Should the system the player is on fail to implement the "being frog"
functionality, the player has a right to pretend he is a frog.

                     PARAGRAPH 3
If a player does not exercise his right to be a frog, or to pretend to be one,
other players have a right to pretend he is a frog.

                     PARAGRAPH 4
If the player feels uncomfortable with the epithet "he", he may substitute
it with a word of his choice in the entire bill of rights.
