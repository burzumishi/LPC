NAME
        teams - groups of players working together

INFORMATION
	A team is a group of players who move and work together, normally with
	the purpose of killing tough monsters or solving quests.
	
	A team always has a leader. This is the person who invites people to
        join him. When a team leader moves from one location to another, all
        team member who are in the first location follow the leader.

	When an opponent is killed by a team member, the experience gained
	is shared between all team members who are present in the room. To
        promote teamplay, a bonus is awarded that increases with the size of
        the team (insofar present).

	When solving quests, the normal case is that only one person can solve
	it and receive experience. There are, however some quests where the
        entire team solves the quest and all members present receive full
        experience.
