NAME
        Experience

SYNOPSIS
        This is not a command, simply information.

DESCRIPTION
        Experience comes in three forms, quest, combat and general experience.
        Quest experience you gain by solving a quest or riddle. When you are
        victorious in battle you get combat experience, and you can also earn
        experience by doing other things, like stealing something, or finding
        a herb. Guild tax is subtracted from your experience as you gain it,
        in return for the services of the guild.

        Quest experience is a special type in that once gained, it cannot be
        lost. When you die, you may lose some combat and general experience.
        Also, quest experience is tax free. That is, your guild still gets
        its due tax on your quest experience, but it is graciously paid for
        by the administration of the realms.

        Your experience is not shown here, but you can see it at your level.
        With the levels command you can see what possible experience levels
        there are (levels mortal). Note that your skills may be much more
        important in combat than your stats.
