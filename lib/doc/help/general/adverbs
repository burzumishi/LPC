DESCRIPTION
        Adverbs can be used together with many emotions. Do "help emotions"
        for more information on the general emotions. Using the "adverbs"
        command you can list all adverbs available for use in conjunction
        with those emotions.

ADVERB USAGE
        When using an adverb in conjunction with an emotion, you can identify
        it by abbreviating it to a minimum of three characters. The search
        algorithm will then always find the first adverb in the list that
        matches your abbreviation. Note that not all adverbs can be accessed
        with only three characters, as typing "hea" will yield heartbrokenly,
        so you need to type at least "hearti" to get heartily. There is one
	exception to this rule, and that is that "sad" will give sadly and not
	sadistically.

        .   Use the period to not use any adverb, not even the default adverb.

        Some adverbs will automatically be replaced by a more suitable phrase.
        For instance, if you "smile friendly", you will actually "smile in a
	friendly manner".

NOTE ON USAGE
        All emotions that can be used with an adverb have a default adverb
        if you do not specify an adverb. To specify that you do not want to
        use an adverb at all, use the period. "smile ." will just make you
        smile and not smile happily for happily is the default adverb for
        the emotion smile. Also note that some emotions (like hug) are by
        default with the adverb ".", so by default without adverb.
