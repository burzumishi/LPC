NAME
	boards - not a real command, though boards have commands.

SYNOPSYS
	list notes           - list the headers of all notes. Examining the
			       board will do the same thing.
	list [notes] <range> - list the headers of the notes in range <range>
	mread [note] <num>   - read the note with number <num> with more
	read [note] <num>    - read the note with number <num> without more
	mread next [note]    - read the next note with more
	read next [note]     - read the next note without more
	remove [note] <num>  - remove the note with number <num>

DESCIPTION
	Bulletin boards can be found all over the game. They are intended
	for discussion and announcements. Most boards are related to a
	particular area or guild, though a few are general to the game. To
	see the headers of the notes on a board you can examine the board or
	use the list command.

	You are free to leave messages on the boards as you please, but
	use your common sense as you do. Profane language and quest
	information do not belong on them.

	When you read a note on a board, you can continue reading notes on
	that board using the "read next" command. In fact, it will just try
	to read the note with the number one higher than the last note you
	tried to read on any bulletin board.

OPTIONS
	note    - use the words note or notes optionally to distinguish
	notes	  the commands from other commands with the same name.
	<num>	- a number indivating a valid message number, i.e. "5".
	<range>	- a range of valid message numbers of the form 'begin-end'
		  of which either the begin or the end may be omitted, i.e.
		  "5 -10", "- 10" or "5-".
