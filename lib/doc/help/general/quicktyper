NAME
	quicktyper - built in quicktyper functionality.

DESCRIPTION
	The quicktyper was designed to offer some functions that make life a
	little easier when typing commands. You can make aliases for long
	commands or commands you use often, you can easily repeat the last
	given command and you can execute a sequence of commands with only
	one command. You can bypass the quicktyper by prefixing a command with
	the dollar $ sign.
