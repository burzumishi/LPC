Events on Genesis Q & A
========================

What are Events?
----------------
Events are one-time  (or few-time)  happenings that are not hard-coded
into the game.  They are run and moderated by wizards,  who may create
items  and/or  NPCs specifically for the event,  and may also play the 
role of general or specific NPCs in the events while they are enacted.
Events in general can be divided into game-like and  (roleplay) quest-
like events.

Example of a game-like event.
-----------------------------
An  example of a  game-like event would be a game-wide scavenger hunt, 
where one has to  acquire  certain items,  and the person who  does so 
fastest wins.  Another example would be an egg-throwing contest, where
the last  person that is not hit would win,  or perhaps the person who
hit most people before he got hit himself. 

Example of a roleplay quest event.
----------------------------------
A  pigeon flies  up to you  and gives you  a message.  You are given a 
message  from  Lord Denethor II  himself,  who requires  your help  in 
recovering his niece,  who has been taken hostage.   You gather a team
around you, and set off to where the abductors were last spotted.  You
interact  with  suspicious  individuals  (NPCs controlled by wizards), 
negotiate  clues,  and eventually,  through wit  and courage,  recover 
Denethor's niece,  (NPC controlled by a wizard)  and bring her back to
safety in Minas Tirith,  where you and your team get rewarded for your
deeds with experience.

Some differences between an event quest and a regular quest.
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Regular quests are  hard-coded into the game  and are available for 
   all mortals. Events are one-time  (or few-time) occurrences,  which
   are available to a subset of all mortals,  often depending on being
   at the right spot at the right time.
2. Regular quests have specific syntaxes.  In events usually a  looser
   form of language can be used because NPCs are wizard controlled.
3. In events,  besides the actual solution,  also Roleplay is  greatly 
   appreciated by the organisers and can be rewarded.
4. Often regular quests can only be done by one person at the time, in
   events  teaming is usually  encouraged,  as this  creates a  richer
   roleplay atmosphere.

Event rewards.
--------------
Rewards can be any or all of the following, depending on the nature of
the event: 
- quest experience, 
- general experience, 
- generally available items such as currency or a good weapon,
- special items, created specifically for the event.

Who are the wizards involved in events?
---------------------------------------
The  Arch of Events  (AoE)  is the  ultimate  responsible  wizard  for 
events.  The  AoE  has a team of wizards  (Event Team)  that  help him  
regulate, promote, co-ordinate, and execute these events.  In addition 
to that,  the Liege of a domain  can also  organise events within  his 
own domain.

How can mortals influence events?
---------------------------------
Mortals can submit their ideas for events  on the board in the  Office 
of the  Arch of Events.  The notes on this board  can not be  read  by
other mortals.  Suitable ideas may be used  by the wizards responsible  
for events.
