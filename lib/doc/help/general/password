NAME
        password - change your password

SYNOPSIS
	password

DESCRIPTION
        When you type the command you will be prompted for your old
	password and when you type it correctly, you will be prompted
	for a new password. Then you are prompted to retype it for
	security reasons. We don't want you to make any typos and be
	unable to log in. If the new passwords match, it will be set.

ADVISE / WARNING
	We advise you to alter your password from time to time. You
	should protect your password at all times and _never_ lend it
	to anyone else. It is the only proof that you are actually
	using the character. The administration cannot be liable in
	any way for missuse. If someone else logs in your character
        and violates a rule, _you_ shall be held accountable. This is
	also valid if you have your password in a mud-client. We therefore
	strongly advise you _not_ to put your password in a client. If
	someone gets access to your client or to your hidden password
	file, that is your problem.
