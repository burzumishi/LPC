SYNOPSIS
        <emotion>
        <emotion> <adverb>
        <emotion> <living>
        <emotion> <adverb> <living> or <emotion> <living> <adverb>
        <emotion> <item>
        <emotion> <adverb> <item> or <emotion> <item> <adverb>

	There is a separate help-page for all emotions mentioned in the
	list above. That help-page will include the complete syntax of
	the emotion and whether they can be used with an adverb, etcetera.
        Most emotions follow this general format, though for instance beg,
	pat, point, poke and scratch can have a different form.

DESCRIPTION
        Emotions can be used in either of these four forms, though not all
        can be used in all forms. In some cases, the adverb comes before the
        living, in some it comes behind.

        <adverb> To get a list of adverbs or to get more information on the
                 use of adverbs in general, type "help adverbs".

        <living> can take several forms. It can be a name or description of
                 one or more people. The use of prepositions for several
                 emotions is optional. The article "the" can also be omitted
                 if you are describing someone. Various emotes can also be
                 performed on non-living items. It is also possible to do
                 some emotes on yourself.

                 "Mercade", "at mercade", "dwarf wizard", "the dwarfs",
                 "all", "up to the friendly dwarf" can all be valid
                 forms for <living>.

        enemy    When you are in combat, you can refer to your enemy with
                 "enemy" when doing an emotion on him/her/it.

        team     The word "team" can be used to refer to all those members
                 of your team that are presently in the room.

        <item>   can take several forms. It can be a name or description of
                 one or more items in the room or in your inventory. The use
                 of prepositions for several emotions is optional.

        smile sadly    -> smile sadly
