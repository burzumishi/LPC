	converse - converse with other people.

SYNOPSYS
	converse

DESCRIPTION
	When you are conversing with someone else and you do not want to
	have to type say or ' all the time, you can use convers mode. When
	you enter converse mode you shall be presented with the prompt ']'
	and everything you type after it you will say to the room. To stop
	conversing, type ** on an empty line. [This mode is also useful if
	you wish to paste text into the screen]. You will not get any echo
	about the stuff you say other than the new prompt.

ESCAPE
	If you wish to execute another command while you are conversing,
	you can do so without leaving the converse mode. All you have to
	do is type an exclamation mark before the command on a new line.
	After the command is executed you will _not_ be presented with a
	new prompt ']', but you will continue to converse.
	Example: !smile at Mercade
