DESCRIPTION
        This isn't a command, but simply information. Many commands, among
        which all emotions, allow the player to specify a target for the
        command. The <target> to these commands can take various forms. In
        this document, these forms are explained.

OPTIONS
        <items>    - various commands can be performed on "dead" objects as
                     well as on living targets. Notice that living and dead
                     items cannot be mixed in the argument. If the command
                     can also be performed on non-livings, this is indicated.
        <people>   - the target or targets you want to perform the emotion
                     on. This may be a name or description of a living or
                     livings, ie. "Mercade", "the dwarf wizard" and "dwarves"
                     are all valid targets.
        enemy      - the person you are currently fighting.
        me/myself  - points at you.
        team       - the members of your team (insofar in the room).

        , and      - it is possible to combine more of the above arguments
                     with comma's and the word "and". Note that a space is
                     not necessary after a comma.
        but/except - exclude targets from your selection. It is possible to
                     use comma's and "and" on both sides of "but/except".
