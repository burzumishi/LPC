NAME
	link death - not a command, just information.

SYNOPSIS
	During game play, connection to the game server can be lost or cut.
	This can either be intentional or unintentional.  

DESCRIPTION
	When a players connection with the game server is lost or cut, the 
	character will be temporarily suspended from the game. Others in the
	area will receive a message to this effect. A player who is link dead
 	is identified with an asterisk (*) in the who-list.

	When connection with the game server is re-established, the character
	will re-appear in the same location where the player was before the
	connection was lost. 

	Characters will stay suspended for a maximum two hours. During this
	time their inventories will remain unchanged. Two hours after the link
	was lost, the player will automatically be logged out. This could lead
	to loss of inventory (specifically the non-recoverable items). The
	auto-loading always remain with the player.

CAUTION
	A character that is engaged in a fight at the moment the link breaks
	will not be removed from the game/fight until combat is over. This may
	involve the character winning the battle, fleeing (wimpy) into a safe
	area, or dying in combat while no connection with the player exists.
	Only once combat is finished, the character be will suspended and shown
	as link dead.
