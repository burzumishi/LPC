NAME
	newchar - create a new character

ACCESS CLASS
	Archwizards and keepers.

SYNOPSYS
        newchar <name> <email address>

DESCRIPTION
	With this command a new character can be created. It is made up
	from the file /secure/proto_char.o, which is set to a state where
	the created character starts in the body-creation room, i.e from
	the very start. However, the specified arguments MUST be given
	by the archwizard as that part of the login is bypassed for the
        player. A password will be automatically created and included in the
        email to the player.

	The commands makes certain there's no conflicts with already
	exisiting, banished or saved players.

ARGUMENTS
	<name>		 - the name of the new character.
	<email address>	 - the email address of the new character.

NOTA BENE
        If you manage to mistype the name of email address of the player,
	you either have to edit the player file manually or remove
	and re-add it in order to correct your mistake, so pay attention
	to what you're doing.

	A message of the newly created character is automatically mailed
	to the intended recipiant. This means you have to take special
	care in typing the address so that you get it right the first
	time. Obviously, a player who don't have a valid email address
	can't be informed about it, and hence never should be allowed
	to get one either...

	The information about new characters is saved and mailed in
	batches once per day.
