        Changing experience

        When changing experience (using the "exp" command), new experience
        is added accourding to the learn preferences while the removal of
        experience is done evenly among all stats. The <amount> is the amount
        of experience to add to or subtract from the particular type of
        experience.

        Changing a stat

        When changing an individual stat, the change in total experience will
        be added to or subtracted from the <type> of experience that is
        indicated. The <amount> is the new value for that stat. Valid stats
        are str, dex, con, int, wis, dis, race, occup and layman.
