SYNOPSIS
	people -[abBdDfhHilLmMnNrRsSVw] [<guild>] [<domain>]

DESCRIPTION
	The command displays information about the number of logged in
	players and their status. You can format the information displayed
 	to you in many ways. See the options described below. The name of
	the player is always shown first no matter which other flags are
	given.

OPTIONS
	[none]	- default as "people -LirRdal".
	-a	- age abbreviated to highest denomination.
	-b	- busy status (see 'help busy' for details).
	-B	- add siteban information to ip number/name (requires -n|-N).
	-d	- domain the player is a member of (the abbreviated name).
	-D	- non-met description.
	-f	- work with the 's' flag and exclude all but the snooped.
	-g	- alignment of the player.
	-G	- sort players on their alignment.
	-h	- sort players on their ip number (ascending).
	-H	- sort players on their ip name (ascending).
	-i	- idle status (I = idle for more than five minutes).
	-l	- location in game (path with ~ tilde).
	-L	- sort players in ascending rank level order.
        -m	- show only mortal players on the list.
	-M	- player met with me (M if met).
	-n	- the player ip number.
	-N	- the player ip name, reverts to number if there is no name.
	-r	- rank title.
	-R	- rank level.
	-s	- if 'S', snooped. Works only if you have right priviliges.
		  This only listes the people who are actually snooped and
		  those that are snooping them.
	-S	- species (abbreciated to only three letters).
	-V	- aVerage stat of player.
        -w	- show only wizards on the list.

	<domain> - display only people that are present in this domain.
	<guild>  - display only those people that are a member of this guild.

NOTE
	The option -A is depreciated. Sorting by name is default behaviour.
        The options -w and -m are mutually exclusive, meaning that only
        one of them will be used. (-w wins in this case.)

	Note that all flags must be preceded by a dash, except for the guild
	or domain name. If an argument is not preceded by a dash and it
	cannot be recognised as guild or domain name, people will not
	execute to prevent spam. Single flags may be without dash.
