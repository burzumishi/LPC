	Welcome to Genesis 3.0

	You enter the game as mortal the first time. Please make yourself
	comfortable with the surroundings as a mortal. An Arch or Keeper
	can promote you to apprentice. 

	When you have found an Arch or a Keeper to promote you you can
	begin to learn the basics of the new world:

	The most important area to look at is the 'Wizard start location'.
	Do 'goto /d/Genesis/wiz/green'. You find boards, post and other info
	here. Direct all questions of the area to Tech. He is its designer.

	As apprentice you have the capability of reading docs and files
	in the standard lib. You can also move about freely and read a
	number of boards. Make yourself familiar with the different areas.

	To get coding access you need to join a domain. A lord of a domain
	can accept you into a domain if you apply for membership. Do
	'help apply' and 'help accept' for more information.

	To find out about domains, lords and much more, use the 'finger'
	command. To get help on how to use it, do 'help finger'

	When you are about to start coding, first read the file:

		/doc/man/general/INTRO

	It summarizes the important changes from 2.4.6 and gives some
	good hints on how to code.

	Enjoy the new World!
