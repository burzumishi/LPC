DESCRIPTION
	The file tracker can be used to keep track of (log) files. You can
	register a file in your list of tracked files. Then, it will keep
	track of whether the file changed since you last read it. To do
	this, the file-time of the last edit action on the file is kept for
	you.

	When you read the file, the "tail" of the file is printed to your
	screen. Using the "rr" subcommand, the "tail -r" is printed, allowing
	you to scroll up in the file.

	A typical "aft l" list looks as follows. The list is sorted based on
	the file name. To refer to a file, you can use the number, the name
	or the full path. An asterisk (*) marks that the file has changed
	since you last tailed it. The greater than (>) sign denotes the log
	you most recently viewed. The rightmost column contains the size of
	the file in bytes. With "aft" or "aft lu" only the files that changed
	(i.e. with an asterisk) are shown.

ARGUMENTS
	[none]	Without arguments, do "aft lu", list all tracked files that
		have changed since they were last read.

	<path>	Start tracking the path <path>. Tilde notation (~) is
		accepted.

	<name>	An optional private name for a file to track. You can use
		this name to refer to the file later. This name may not be
		longer than eight characters.

	<file>	Index to the file you want to handle. This can be the number
		of the file in the list of files you track, or the private
		name you assigned to a file. It can also be the path of the
		file (including tilde notation).

SEE ALSO
	tail
 
CAVEAT
	With aft, a wizard will force him/herself to tail a particular file.
        Therefore, using %% after an "aft r" will result in the same file being
	tailed again, and not in another "aft r".
