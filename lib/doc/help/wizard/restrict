NAME
	restrict - put restrictions on a wizard

SYNOPSIS
	restrict <wizard>
	restrict <wizard> <restriction>

ACCESS LEVEL
	Mentor, Steward++

DESCRIPTION
	With this command a Liege, Steward or Mentor for a specific
	wizard can restrict a wizard to certain degrees.

	finger command.

	While a mentor might have several students, a student can only
	have one mentor. Unless the mentor is an archwizard both the
	student and the mentor must belong to the same domain.

	For reasons of common sense, it's not allowed to restrict
	wizards of rank Steward and up. If the need to restrict
	their actions arises, it's better to demote them to a more
	suitable level instead.

ARGUMENTS
	restrict <wizard>
	   Displays the current restrictions of a wizard within your
	   domain or responsability as mentor.

	restrict list
	   Lists all wizards with restrictions. For Stweards or Lords,
	   only the restricted wizards in their domain are listed.

	restrict <wizard> snoop  (short: s)
	   The wizard is not allowed to snoop anyone. This restriction
	   excludes the "snoopdom" restriction, if turned on.

	restrict <wizard> snoopdom (short: sd)
	   The wizard is not allowed to snoop anyone standing outside
	   the domain rooms. Naturally, the snoop will not be broken
	   if the snooped person walks outside the domain again. This
	   restriction excluded the "snoop" restriction, if turned on.

	restrict <wizard> rw / w
           With 'rw' the wizard will not be able to read, write or ftp
           files outside of his home directory. With 'w' the wizard will
           not be able to write files outside of his home directory, but
           he will be able to read files in his domain. To give access,
           a sanction to a specific directory can be used (but domain
           sanctions will not work).

	restrict <wizard> log
	   All wizard commands are logged in a file placed in the
	   /d/<Domain>/domain/private/restrictlog directory with
	   the wizard's name. This file is accessable to the
	   registered mentor of the wizard, even though it resides
	   in the domain private dir.

	   Please remember to remove the log from time to time so
	   that it doesn't grow too big. The log does cycle at
	   50 kB (approx 1000 entries), but it's still always a good
	   idea not to have large files taking up room when not needed.

	restrict <wizard> stat
	   The wizard is not allowed to stat monsters or players. He
	   is given a message to this effect when trying to perform
	   the command. Please note that it's possible to work around
           this restriction by making individual calls to the functions
           that provide the stat information. Please also note that
	   trying to evade a restriction is a demotion offense.

	restrict <wizard> all
	   Turns on all restrictions (not snoopdom) of a wizard.

	restrict <wizard> none
	   Turns off all restrictions of a wizard.
