ACCESS LEVEL
	All wizards can list guilds. Domain wizards can add/remove themselves
	as guildmaster to/from a guild. Lieges and stewards can do everything,
	but limited to their own domain, except adding guilds. Arches and
	keepers do all, any time, any place, anywhere.

DESCRIPTION
	The command maintains the repository information on all guilds in the
	game. All open guilds must be registered here. Guilds that are being
	developed and are either closed or in development/testing phase can
	also be registered, but that is not mandatory if they have not been
	open yet. All guilds must have a guildmaster registered at any time.
	This may not be the Liege of the domain as pro forma guildmaster, but
	naturally the Liege may also be the guildmaster of a particular guild.

	The names of the registered guilds can be used in the commands people
	and guildtell. There is a similar command managing the repository of
	clubs.

	The following subcommands exist:

	add    - Add a guild to the registry. A newly added guild will be
		 marked as being under development.

	info   - Print verbose information about a guild.

	list   - List all guilds in a table. "short" will only print all short
	         names of the guilds. "styles" will sort the guilds by styles,
		 "domain" will sort the guilds by domain and "<type>" will list
		 only the guilds of that particular type. The type must be
		 abbreviated to one letter R/C/L/O.

	master - Allows to add or remove someone to/from the list of
		 guildmasters registered for this guild.

	phase  - The guildmaster of a guild (or a steward/liege/admin) may
		 herewith alter the phase of a guild.

	remove - Removes a guild from the registry.

ARGUMENTS
	<domain> - The domain to which the guild is to be registered. This is
		   only relevant for arches/keepers as for all others, the
		   name of the domain cannot be changed. Others should omit
		   this argument.

	<guild>  - The 'short' name of the guild. It must be a single word of
		   ten characters or less. This name will be printed to mortal
                   players. No other guild or club may use this name.

	<long>   - The 'long' name of the guild. This must be exactly the same
		   as what is being returned by the name function in the
		   shadow. This name will be printed to mortal players. No
		   other guild or club may use this name.

	<phase>  - The phase of development and of a guild. This can be either
		   'development', 'testing', 'open' or 'closed'.

	<style>  - The style of the guild, as returned by the style function
		   in the shadow.

	<type>   - The type of the guild, i.e. the slots the guild takes. All
		   types must be abbreviated to their first letter, R/C/L/O
		   for respectively racial, craft, layman or occupational.

	<wizard> - Name of the wizard to add or remove as guildmaster. When
		   the argument is omitted, you will add/remove yourself.
