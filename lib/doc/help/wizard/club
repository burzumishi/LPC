SYNOPSYS
	club add <domain> <club> <wizard> <long>
	club [info] <club>
	club [list]
	club list short
	club list styles / domain
	club list <type>
	club master <club> add/remove [<wizard>]
	club phase <club> <phase>

ACCESS LEVEL
	All wizards can list clubs. Domain wizards can add/remove themselves
	as clubmaster to/from a club. Lieges and stewards can do everything,
	but limited to their own domain. Arches and keepers do all, any time,
	any place, anywhere.

DESCRIPTION
	The command maintains the repository information on all clubs in the
	game. All open clubs must be registered here. Guilds that are being
	developed and are either closed or in development/testing phase can
	also be registered, but that is not mandatory if they have not been
	open yet. All clubs must have a clubmaster registered at any time.
	This may not be the Liege of the domain as pro forma clubmaster, but
	naturally the Liege may also be the clubmaster of a particular club.

	There is a similar command managing the repository of guilds.

	The following subcommands exist:

	add    - Add a club to the registry. A newly added club will be
		 marked as being under development.

	info   - Print verbose information about a club.

	list   - List all clubs in a table. "short" will only print all short
	         names of the clubs. "domain" will sort the clubs by domain.

	master - Allows to add or remove someone to/from the list of
		 clubmasters registered for this club.

	phase  - The clubmaster of a club (or a steward/liege/admin) may
		 herewith alter the phase of a club.

	remove - Removes a club from the registry.

ARGUMENTS
	<domain> - The domain to which the club is to be registered. This is
		   only relevant for arches/keepers as for all others, the
		   name of the domain cannot be changed. Others should omit
		   this argument.

	<club>   - The 'short' name of the club. It must be a single word of
		   ten characters or less. This name will be printed to mortal
                   players. No other club or guild may use this name.

	<long>   - The 'long' name of the club. As clubs have no shadow, this
		   name cannot be used to find people by their shadow. This
		   name will be printed to mortal players. No other club or
		   guild may use this name.

	<phase>  - The phase of development and of a club. This can be either
		   'development', 'testing', 'open' or 'closed'.

	<wizard> - Name of the wizard to add or remove as clubmaster. When
		   the argument is omitted, you will add/remove yourself.
