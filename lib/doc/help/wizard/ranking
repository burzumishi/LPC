	- Rank# is: Base rank * Weight
	- Base rank is the number of mortal commands
	- Weight is: (100 + Quest/25 + (-Combat)/10000) / 100
	- Quest is the number of quest xp given by the domain to mortals
	- Combat is the number of combat xp given by the domain to mortals

OPTIONS:
	all		Give the entire ranking list
	num		Give the part of the ranking list centered on 'num'
	Domain		Give ranking of a specific domain

NOTA BENE
	A command is counted for the domain if a mortals does an action 
	with one of the domains objects. This is true anywhere in the
	mud. It is the object defining the add_action() of the executed
	command that counts.

	Experience however are counted as to where in the mud it is given.
	If a mortal gets experience for some reason or the other. It is
	the domain in which room the mortal is that gets credited with
	that experience.

	Commands and given experience are not counted for wizards or for
	wizard helpers. A wizard helper _must_ be called Namejr. As all
	wizard helpers are mortals, commands would be counted otherwise.

WARNING
	There is a lot of ways to fool the ranking list. The simplest 
	being running with your own mortal characters in your area. The
	list is there for a purpose. If you cheat, it is simply foul play.
	Wizards doing that risk demotion for the entire domain.
