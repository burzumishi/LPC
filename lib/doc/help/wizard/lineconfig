NAME
	line config - manage the channels.

SYNOPSIS
	line config add <name> to <channel>
	line config create <status> <channel>
	line config expel <name> from <channel>
	line config join <channel>
	line config leave <channel>
	line config list [<channel>]
	line config owner <name> of <channel>
	line config remove <channel>

DESCRIPTION
      -	line config list <channel>
	line config list

	This gives you a list of all the channels you can join and all
	the listed members to those channels. If you add the name of a
	channel you will get the information only for that channel.

      -	line config create <status> <channel>

	Create the channel named <channel> and become its owner. If you
	make the channel 'open' this means everyone may join it. Else, if
	you make it 'closed', only you (and arches++) will be able to add
	new members to the channel. Being owner gives you the right to add
	others to the channel, remove them from the channel and remove the
	channel entirely. The channel-name may have a maximum length of
	eight characters, preferably only letters.

      -	line config remove <channel>

	Remove the channel entirely. This is only possible if you are the
	owner of the channel (or an arch++). Domain lines cannot be removed.

      -	line config join <channel>

	Join the channel <channel>. This is only possible for open channels.
	If you want to join a closed channel, the owner must add you. It is
	not possible to join a domain line. If you are a member of the
	domain you are automatically a member and others must stay clear
	from the line.

      -	line config leave <channel>

	Leave the channel <channel>. You cannot leave a domain-line.
	Membership of the domain line comes with membership of the domain.

      -	line config add <name> to <channel>

	If you are the owner of the channel (or an arch++) you may add a
	wizard to the channel. For closed channels, it is imparative that
	you personally add all members since they cannot join the channel
	themselves.

      -	line config expel <name> from <channel>

	If you are the owner of a channel (or an arch++) you may expel a
	wizard from the channel.

      - line config owner <name> of <channel>

	If you are the owner of a channel (or an arch++) you can assign a new
	owner to the channel.

ARGUMENTS
	<channel> - the name of the channel to manipulate.
	<name>    - the name of a wizard.
	<status>  - the status of the channel, either 'open' or 'closed'.
