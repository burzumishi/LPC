NAME
	domainsanction - manage a domains sanction list

ACCESS LEVEL
	Arches and keepers can do all, Lords can only alter the sanctions in
	their own domains and all wizards can view sanctions.

SYNOPSIS
	domainsanction
	domainsanction <domain>
	domainsanction <domain> c[lear]
	domainsanction <domain> <name>
	domainsanction <domain> <name> <type>
	domainsanction <domain> <name> <type> <path>

	There is a built in alias "dsanction" for this command.

DESCRIPTION
	Use this command without argument to see your own domains sanction
	list and with only a domain name to see the sanction list of a
	domain. Via a sanction a domain can allow someone to read or write
	in the domain directory. The general domain sanctions do not reveal
	the contents of the domains ~/private directory. The possible
	sanctions are:
	    r - read rights to the domain directories or a particular path.
	    R - read rights to the domain directories including the
		wizards directories.
	    w - write rights in the domain directories or a particular path.
	    W - write rights in the domain directories including the
		wizards directories.

ARGUMENTS
	[none]	- display your domains sanction list.
	<domain>- the name of the domain to display or alter sanctions in.
	clear	- clear the complete sanction list of the domain.
	<name>	- the receiver of the sanction. This can either be a wizard,
		  a domain or "all" to indicate all wizards.
	<type>	- one or more sanctions to toggle. Note that the individual
		  sanctions are toggled, for an example, see "help sanction"
		  When the <type> is omitted, all sanctions from <domain> to
		  <name> will be removed.
	<path>	- a particular directory for which the sanction applies. Note
		  that a directory sanction will reveal the contents of the
		  ~/private directories for domains or wizards.

NOTA BENE
	The <path> for a directory sanction is relative to the domain root
	directory. This means that to allow someone to write in the directory
	/d/Standard/start/rooms you have to give the following command:

	domainsanction Standard <name> w start/rooms

	Do not include the domain-name, tilde notation or a leading slash.
	This might be accepted by the domainsanction command, but will never
	result in a usable sanction!
