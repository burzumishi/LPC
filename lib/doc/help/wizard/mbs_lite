MBS Lite - A simple introduction into MBS, the ultimate bulletin board reader
=============================================================================

MBS is a rich tool with many many features. This abundance may make MBS a bit
intimidating, and setting up MBS is a bit as setting up a TV set. It is hassle
to get all the channels installed, but when that is done, it works very well.
This help page provides a short overview of the common commands that allow one
to read, post and delete notes. Note that MBS remembers the last note you read
on a board, so if you read note 15 then it assumes notes 1-14 to be read, too.

    mbs             - List all your subscribed boards with unread notes.
    mbs r           - Read the next unread note, cycle subscribed boards.
    mbs r <number>  - Read a specific note on your currently selected board.
    mbs <board>     - Select a specific board (to post on it, for instance).
    mbs p <header>  - Post a note on the currently selected board.
    mbs d <number>  - Delete a note from the currently selected board.
    mbs h [board]   - Display all unread headers of a [specified] board.
    mbs H [board]   - Display all headers of a [specified] board.
    mbs t [board]   - Teleport yourself to a [specified] board.

Syntax: [] is optional, <> is a required. Hint: Use "mr" to read with more.

Before you can use MBS, it is necessary to subscribe to one or more boards. To
do this, the following commands are helpful.

    mbs l                     - List all your subscribed boards.
    mbs L [category]          - List all unsubscribed boards [in a category].
    mbs s <board> <category>  - Subscribe to a board.
    mbs u <board> [category]  - Unsubscribe from a board.

Available categories may include the following:

    adm      - General boards for wizards.
               Mandatory reading: "news", "admin" and "info" (common board).
    area     - Boards located in towns and cities ("human" is Sparkle).
    develop  - Boards related to coding and development.
    guild    - Public guild boards (readable to non-member players).
    guildint - Private guild boards (readable only to member players).
    misc     - Miscellaneous boards unrelated to the game as such.
