DESCRIPTION
        A suspension means that the player that is suspended will not be able
        to enter the game for the duration of the suspension. A player that is
        in the realms at the moment he or she is suspended, will be forced to
        quit immediately. There is no limit on the duration of the suspension.
        Lifting a suspension can also be used to clear a self-imposed playing
        restriction by the player.

WARNING
        Suspension is a serious administrative measure. It should not be used
        lightly and it is discouraged to use it as method of intimidation.

                   restriction.
