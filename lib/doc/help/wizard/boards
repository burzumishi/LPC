NAME
	boards - not a real command, though boards have commands.

SYNOPSYS
	store [note] <num> <file>
	rename [note] <num> <name>

DESCIPTION
	In addition to the board commands that are available to all players,
	there are two commands that only wizards can use. A wizard that can
	read a message <num>, can store it in a file with the store command.

	When the wizard is an owner of the board, he can also write a note
	on it and then set a new author name with the rename command. This
	may only be done for roleplaying reasons. Obviously the new name may
	NOT be used by a player in the game. Owners of the board are the
	administration, the Lord of the domain and the wizards of the domain
	if the board is not in a wizards personal directory.

OPTIONS
	note    - use the word note optionally to distinguish the
		  commands from other commands with the same name.
	<num>	- a number indivating a valid message number, i.e. "5".
	<name>	- the name of the (non-existant) new author of a note.
	<file>	- the name of the file to store the message in.
