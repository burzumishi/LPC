Property   : CONT_I_MAX_VOLUME
 
Defined    : <stdproperties.h>
 
Description: This property keeps the maximum volume of the container, being
             the maximum contents of the container plus the volume of the
             empty container.

Example    : A crate may have the following values for the properties:
             CONT_I_MAX_VOLUME   50,000
             CONT_I_VOLUME       10,000
             OBJ_I_VOLUME        15,000
              This means that the empty box has a volume of 10 liters, it can
             hold a total of 40 liters of goods, so the maximum for that box
             (empty volume + contents) is 50 liters. Currently, the box holds
             5 liters worth of goods.
