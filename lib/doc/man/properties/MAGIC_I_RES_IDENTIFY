MAGIC_I_RES_IDENTIFY    The percentage of resistance an object has to
                        "identify" spells before divulging its properties
                        to the caster of a spell. If the spell succeeds,
                        the property MAGIC_AM_ID_INFO should be used to
                        hold the information gained.
