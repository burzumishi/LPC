Arguments  : Array of objects

Description: When sparring, this array contains a list of the objects that the
             living is sparring. Sparring is combat that does not result in a
             death. Note that the person is only protected from death by the
             objects that are mentioned in the array. This means that when a
             weapon or special attack does not pass the pointer to the killing
             _living_ along to do_die(), then sparring does not provide any
             protection.
