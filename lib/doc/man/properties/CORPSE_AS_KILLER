name   : CORPSE_AS_KILLER

returns: ({ <name>, <nonmet> })

This property will be set in each corpse when someone dies. It is set from
the function do_die(). It returns an array of two strings where <name> is
the "real name" [lowercase] of the killer and <nonmet> is the description
someone gets to see if he or she does not know the killer, generally refered
to by "nonmet name" or "nonmet description". If the killer is still in the
game, he or she might be tracked using the functions find_player() [will
only find players] or find_living() [finds both players and NPC's that have
their living name set].
