ROOM_I_HIDE			Defines how hard it is to hide in a room. This
				should be a value between 0 and 100 since the
				hiding skill never can be > 100. If the value
				is set to -1 it will be impossible to hide in
				the room.

                                In this, 0 means it is trivially easy to
                                hide and 100 utterly difficult to hide.
