LIVE_AS_ATTACK_FUMBLE           Setting this prop will cause the player to
				fumble. It should be set to and array of strings
			 	so that many objects can cause the player to
				fumble at once. The first string in the array
				will be sent to 'me' via catch_msg() so VNFC:s
				should be possible to use.
