Definition : CONT_I_HOLDS_COMPONENTS

Description: Set this property to 1 when the container can hold components
             for spells that the caster can quickly grab from what he needs
	     in order to cast a spell, and thus should be checked when casting
	     a spell. This could be small pouches or jars, but should not be
	     used for bulky backpacks.

Value      : (int) - 1 - it can hold components, check it.
                     0 - doesn't hold components, don't check it.
