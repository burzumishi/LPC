CONT_I_CLOSED           The container can be closed, 1 if closed 0 if open.
                        In an open container the inventory is visible
                        and light passes out through it.

                        This property controls if things can be moved in
                        and out of the container at the moment. Note that
                        CONT_M_IN and CONT_M_NO_REM are more general.

                        This property will be used as a general command to
                        open and close nonlocked containers.
