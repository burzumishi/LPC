OBJ_I_VOLUME            Defines the volume of the object.
                        The basic volume unit is the cubic centimeter.
                        NOTE:
                        This property always gives the total volume of an
                        object. If the object is a nonrigid container it gives
                        the sum of all volumes involved.
