LIVE_O_SPELL_ATTACK             This is used to make introduce special attacks
                                in the combat system. It should hold the
                                object to call 'spell_attack()' in. What
                                happens is that when a living is ready to
                                run through its normal attacks it will
                                instead call: ob->spell_attack(me, enemy)
                                and then remove the property.
