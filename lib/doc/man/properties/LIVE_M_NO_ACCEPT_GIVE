Property: LIVE_M_NO_ACCEPT_GIVE

Argument: (string) message
          (int)    1

Purpose : When defined, the living will not accept any gifts. In NPC's,
          this property is defined by default. It can also be used in
          players.

          Setting the property to 1 will give the default fail message
          "Give what to whom?"

          Setting the property to a string will have that string
          appended to the name of the living. "Name<message>".

Note    : This property used to be called NPC_M_NO_ACCEPT_GIVE, and is
          still present for backward compatibility, but should not be
          used anymore.
