CONT_I_REDUCE_VOLUME    How much does this container reduces the volume of
                        stuff being put in a container in it? A value of 50 will
                        double the volume of stuff moved into the container. And
                        you don't have to bother about it.

                        This prop should never be set to 0!!!
