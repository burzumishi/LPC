Definition : LIVE_I_NO_GENDER_DESC

Defined in : #include <stdproperties.h>

Description: When added to a living with the argument TRUE (1), then this
             living will not show the gender string (male/female) in the
             short description. Neuters won't have their gender strings
             shown anyways.
