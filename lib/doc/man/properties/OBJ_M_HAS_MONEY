Include : #include <stdproperties.h>
Property: OBJ_M_HAS_MONEY

Purpose : This property indicates that the object contains money without
          actually having coin objects. It is especially designed for use
          in NPC's that have some money with them when they are cloned.
          To use the property, just add it to the NPC with the desired
          value, rather than clone coins into the NPC at creation time.

Values  : (int)   cc
          (array) ({ cc, sc, gc, pc })          (omit trailing zero's!)

          There are two types or arguments possible. It can be either an
          integer holding the total amount of copper coins equivalent or
          it can be array with the exact amount of coins per type. In the
          array form, trailing zero's may be omitted!

Macros  : Two macros in <macros.h> can be used in conjuction with this
          property: MONEY_EXPAND(obj) and MONEY_CONDENSE(obj). They
          respectively expand the property value into real coin objects
          and condense real coin objects into a property value. When the
          property value is expanded into real objects, a slight random
          is used if only a total copper coin equivalent is given.
