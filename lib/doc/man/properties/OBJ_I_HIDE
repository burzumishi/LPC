Name       : OBJ_I_HIDE

Defined in : <stdproperties.h>

Description: When defined in an object, this item is hidden from view. How
             well it is hidden depends on the value, which should be in the
             range 1 - 100 with the following meanings:

               0 - not hidden (property is removed).
               1 - very superficially hidden, visible to almost anyone.
             100 - perfectly hidden, invisible to almost all.

             Note that the value of this property is usually compared to the
             SS_AWARENESS skill of the onlooking player. When a player is
             (being) revealed, don't remove the property, but call the
             function living->reveal_me(1);

Argument   : int - the value indicating how well hidden in range 1 - 100.
