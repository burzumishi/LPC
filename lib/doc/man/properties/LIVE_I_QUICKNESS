Property   : LIVE_I_QUICKNESS

Description: Determines the delay between combat rounds. Positive values reduce
             the delay (and thus increase speed) and negative values increase
	     it (and thus slow the person down).

             This prop should be added and removed from. The added value is however
             tracked separately based on setting object so all addition and removal
             on the prop should be done by the same object.

Formula    : Speed = 100.0 / F_SPEED_MOD(quickness) - 100

Effect     : Due to the nature of the formula, the positive and negative scales
	     are not the same. You have to set to 250 to effectively double the
	     speed of the person, and to -500 to halve the speed.
