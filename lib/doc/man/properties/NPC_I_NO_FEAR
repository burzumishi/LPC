Property name: NPC_I_NO_FEAR

This property should be added and set to 1 in an NPC if that NPC should
always attack, even if it would normally fail the discipline check. An
example of this would be a mad dog that would attack anything that moves
without thinking about the possibly negative consequences this has for
his health. [But then, it was a mad dog ;-) ]

By default, this property is not set in NPC's. Remember that only setting
it to 1 is useful. When setting it to 0, you should better remove it.

Note that when using this property, there must be a reasonable explanation
for using it from an atmospherical point of view, this to the discretion of
the AoB. This property may NEVER be set in mortal players!
