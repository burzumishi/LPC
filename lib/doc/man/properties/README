All properties have a type-identifier in the name. This will hopefully add
to the readability and useability.

_Ax_	Array
_I_	Integer
_M_	Mixed
_O_	Object
_S_	String
_V_	VBFC (value by function call parameter)

The x in the _Ax_ identifier simply indicates the type of the array.
_AI_ means array of integer etc.
