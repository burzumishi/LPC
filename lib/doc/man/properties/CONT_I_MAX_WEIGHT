Property   : CONT_I_MAX_WEIGHT
 
Defined    : <stdproperties.h>
 
Description: This property keeps the maximum weight of the container, being
             the maximum contents of the container plus the weight of the
             empty container.
Example    : A crate may have the following values for the properties:
             CONT_I_MAX_WEIGHT   50,000
             CONT_I_WEIGHT       10,000
             OBJ_I_WEIGHT        15,000
              This means that the empty box has a weight of 10 kilos, it can
             hold a total of 40 kilos of goods, so the maximum for that box
             (empty volume + contents) is 50 kilos. Currently, the box holds
             5 kilos worth of goods.
