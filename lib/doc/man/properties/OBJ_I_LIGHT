OBJ_I_LIGHT             Defines the brightness of the object if it
                        generates or absorbs light. Positive integers
                        are light generators, negative numbers are
                        darkness generators.
                        NOTE:
                        This property always gives the total light of an
                        object. If the object is a transparent container it
                        gives the sum of all lights involved.
