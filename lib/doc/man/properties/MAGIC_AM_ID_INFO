MAGIC_AM_ID_INFO        This property defines the information that is found
                        if an "identify" spell succeeds. The information
                        should be stored like an array with pairs of strings
                        and integers (percentage values). The resulting value
                        of the success of the cast spell can then be used to
                        find the corresponding string. In this way you will
                        get some information if you succeed with the spell,
                        but maybe not all of the information if the success
                        was slight.

Example:                ({ "This doesn't tell much", 20,
                           "This tells a little more", 40,
                           "This tells all there is to tell", 60 })
