Property   : ROOM_S_EXIT_FROM_DESC
 
Include    : #include <stdproperties.h>
 
Description: For the eight default exits, as well as in/out/up/down there is
             a default message printed when people walk into a room. This
             message looks like "X arrives from the east." or "from inside."
             Using this property, it is possible to define a different message.
             This is especially useful for inside rooms. This property is not
             meant to be defined in every room to describe where the player
             comes from. In most cases "from the east." is quite enough.
 
Usage      : This property should be added to the room that the player leaves.
             Meaning that a bakery could have the property "from the bakery."
             set.
 
Argument   : (string) <message>
             The description of where the living arrives from. This must fit
             the sentence "X arrives <message>". Please note that the trailing
             period must be added to the <message>. Neither a leading space,
             nor a trailing newline should not be added.
 
Example    : "from the bakery."
