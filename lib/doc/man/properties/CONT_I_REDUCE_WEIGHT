CONT_I_REDUCE_WEIGHT    How much does this container reduces the weight of
                        stuff being put in a container in it?  A value of 200
                        will half the weight. This is used to let a player
                        carry more through a bag. Livings have value 200 and
                        normal containers 100. This is set in livings and you
                        don't have to bother about it normally.

                        This prop should never be set to 0!!!
