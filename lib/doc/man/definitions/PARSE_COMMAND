Definition  : (object *) PARSE_COMMAND( str, invenv, pattern )

Defined in  : <cmdparse.h>

Description : The gamedriver routine parse_command() is a very powerful
              routine for parsing text, but requires a certain amount of
	      post processing. This macro does most of this post processing
	      and simply returns an array of the items that match.

Arguments   : string str - the text to parse and match (player input).
              mixed invenv -  the items to test. This can take several forms.
	          If 0, then the inventory and environment of this_player()
		  are used. If a single object, then the deep_inventory() of
		  that object is used. If an array of objects, then that
		  specific array is used.
	      string pattern - the pattern to test against.
	          See "man parse_command" for details. Generally something
		  like "[the] %i" or the like.

Returns     : object * - the list of objects that matched, or 0.
