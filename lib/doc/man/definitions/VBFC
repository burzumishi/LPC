Syntax     : VBFC(string func)

OBSOLETE   : With the introduction of functionpointers, the definition VBFC()
             became obsolete. It is only kept for backwards compatibility and
             for those few cases where functionpointers are not applicable.
             Where possible you should use a functionpointer.

Description: Use this definition to get the VBFC representation of the function
             func, when setting a VBFC-string as argument. Note if you want it
             to be possible to call this function from outside this object, use
             VBFC_ME(func) instead since that definition also specifies in what
             object the function should be called.

Argument   : string func - the name of the function that should be called
                 through VBFC.

Returns    : string - The VBFC format of the name of the function func.
