Name       : string NO_DEFAULT_ADVERB_WITH_SPACE

Defined in : /sys/adverbs.h

Description: This "adverb" is used to differ on default adverbs for use with
             a target or as a general emote. If you passed NO_DEFAULT_ADVERB
             as default adverb to check_adverb, check_adverb_with_space,
             parse_adverb or parse_adverb_with_space and if the player did
             not pass an adverb both parse_adverb and check_adverb will
             return NO_DEFAUL_ADVERB and parse_adverb_with_space and
             check_adverb_with_space will return NO_DEFAULT_ADVERB_WITH_SPACE.
             You can check on these adverbs and then assign your own default
             adverb after you have checked whether the player wanted to use
             the emotion on a target or not.
