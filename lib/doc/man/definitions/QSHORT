QSHORT(ob)	If used in say() the short description of ob will be evaluated
		for each reciever through VBFC. Nice to use if one object
		looks different to different players.
		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.
