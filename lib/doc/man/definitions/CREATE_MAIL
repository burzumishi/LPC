Define : CREATE_MAIL(subject, author, to, cc, body)

Purpose: This macro allows you to have mail messages generated and sent from
         code. This is especially meant for administrative messages. Use it
         reluctantly! It is definitely not the intention to replace logs by
         an abundance of mail.

Params : The arguments are as follows:

         subject - The subject of the note, maximum length of 35 characters
         author  - The lower case name of the alleged author of the note.
                   Can be any name (string) of between 2 and 11 characters.
         to      - A comma-separated lower case string of names to receive
                   the message.
         cc      - A comma-separated lower case string of names to receive
                   a carbon copy of the message, or "" for no CC recipients.
         body    - The body text of the message. Lines should be separated
                   with newlines, and a trailing newline is not necessary.
                   The body text is automatically prepended with a line
                   saying that this mail message is automatically generated.

Notice : It is the responsibility of the author of the code to make sure that
         the strings for 'to' and 'cc' only contain valid player names. Else,
         the mail will not be sent.

Returns: (int) 1 if the mail is succesfully sent, else 0.

Misuse : Misuse of this macro, by impersonating another person, or otherwise,
         be it meant seriously or as joke will be punished by demotion,
         deletion or worse.
