Synopsis   : (string)HANGING_INDENT(text, indent, width)

Defined in : #include <composite.h>

Description: Returns <text> with a hanging indent, i.e. the first line is
             printed at the first column and subsequent lines are indented
             with <indent> spaces. The maximal indent is 20 characters.

Arguments  : string text - the text to indent. Should not have a trailing \n.
             int indent - the number of spaces to indent the second and
                 further lines with.
             int width - if <width> is 0, use the screen width of the player,
                 for 1 use the default (80 character screen) and for any other
                 value, use that value. Advice: Normally use 0 for this value.

             added automatically!

             whole text with a single space between "is" and "printed" and do:
             HANGING_INDENT("Description: Returns ... characters.", 13, 0)
