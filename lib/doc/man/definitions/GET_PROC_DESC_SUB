Definition : (string) GET_PROC_DESC_SUB(value, maindescs, subdescs, turnindex)

Description: Match the value in a range 0-100% to a series of main and sub
             descriptions using a uniform distribution of descriptions over the
             value range.

             The turnindex allows the user to invert the array of sub descs for
             the lower range of the main descs depending on their meaning. This
             way can be "extremely healthy" and "extremely sick" at both ends
             of the scale.

Arguments  : int value     - the value to transform to a description.
             string *maind - the main descriptions to choose from.
             string *subd  - the sub descriptions to choose from. These must
                             end with a space unless for an empty string.
             int turnindex - if the main desc index < turnindex, then the sub
                             desc array is inverted.

Returns    : string - the description associated with the value.
