/*
 * PARSE_THIS(s, p)
 *
 * This define gives access to the function parse_this() that was originally
 * in the basic soul COMMAND_DRIVER so that people would not have to copy it
 * everywhere. Now parse_this() resides in COMMANDS_LIBRARY which can be
 * inherited into code. Still this definition may provide quick access to the
 * same.
 *
 * s - the string to parse
 * p - the pattern to parse with
 *
 * For more information see "sman parse_this" for the description of
 * the function itself.
 *
 * An alternative would be to include <files.h> and then do:
 *     oblist = (object *)COMMANDS_LIBRARY->parse_this(s, p [, ...]);
 * or inherit "/lib/commands" and then do:
 *     oblist = parse_this(s, p [, ...]);
