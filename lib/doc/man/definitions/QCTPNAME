*Defined in /sys/macros.h

QCTPNAME(ob)	Works like QTNAME but capitalizes the possessive form of the
		name or description before it is printed.
                (see /std/living/description.c: query_The_possessive_name).

		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.

                     This should never be used in a message directed to a
                     single target.  If the message is intended for a single
                     target, use a direct call to query_The_possessive_name()
		     instead.
