Synopsys   : FILTER_IS_WIZARD(x)

Defined in : /sys/filter_funs.h

Description: This filter returns an array with only those objects that are
             wizards. Note that unless it checks query_wiz_level() in the
             person. It should not be used for serious access checks, but
             will suffice if you just need all wizards in a room for a
             message or something like that.
Arguments  : object *x - the array with objects to filter.
Returns    : object *  - an array with only objects that are wizard.
