Macro   : MONEY_EXPAND(obj)

Purpose : This macro will check the OBJ_M_HAS_MONEY property in the object
          'obj' and if it exists, it will expand the value of that property
          to real coin objects. If the property is in array-form, it will
          expand exactly that amount of coins per type. If the property is in
          the form of a single integer, a little random is used to create the
          coins.          

Argument: (object) obj - the object to check the OBJ_M_HAS_MONEY property in
          and expand it into real coins if it exists.

Reverse : The macro MONEY_CONDENSE(obj) has the reverse effect.

Warning : This macro is not meant to be used in domain code just like that.

          first to discuss it.
