*Defined in /sys/macros.h

QPNAME(ob)	VBFC call, returns the possessive form of the name of ob if
		the object who resolves the VBFC knows ob. Otherwise the
		possessive form of the nonmet name is returned.
                (see /std/living/description.c: query_art_possessive_name)

		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.

                     This should never be used in a message directed to a
                     single target.  If the message is intended for a single
                     target, use a direct call to query_art_possessive_name()
		     instead.
