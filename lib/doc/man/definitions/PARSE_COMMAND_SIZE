Definition  : (int) PARSE_COMMAND_SIZE

Defined in  : <cmdparse.h>

Description : This is a support macro for PARSE_COMMAND_ONE. When that macro
              finds something else than a single object (0 or >= 2) then this
	      macro can be used to find out how many items were actually
	      found (provided you care). It is most specifically helpful to
	      give a nice message depending on whether no items were found at
	      all or whether too many items were found.

Arguments   : None.

Returns     : int - the number of items found by PARSE_COMMAND_ONE.

Example     : Find a single object in the player's inventory or environment.

    object target;
    target = PARSE_COMMAND_ONE(str, 0, "[the] %i");
    if (!objectp(target))
    {
        notify_fail(capitalize(query_verb()) + " what?" +
            (PARSE_COMMAND_SIZE ? " Please select only one item." : "") + "\n");
        return 0;
    }
