Name       : int MEMBER_ADVERB(string pattern)

Defined in : /sys/adverbs.h

Description: Returns the index of the pattern in the array of known adverbs
             or -1 if the adverb is not found. The pattern is supposed to
             have matched a known adverb is it at least three characters long
             and if the pattern matches exactly with the begin of an adverb
             from the list of the known adverbs.

             If a member of the array SERVICE_ADVERBS_ARRAY is passed as
             pattern, -2 is returned.

Caveat     : To search for the adverbs in the list of known adverbs, binary
             search is used. This means that the first match that is found may
             not always the first alphabetical adverb that would match the
             pattern. For instance if the pattern is "sad" it is possible to
             find "sadly" sooner than "sadistically" though this may change
             with adverbs are added to or removed from the list of known
             adverbs. Therefor a player should specify "sadl" or "sadi" to
             be sure, provided that there are no other adverbs what start
             with those four characters.
