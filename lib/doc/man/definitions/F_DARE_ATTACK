Formula    : F_DARE_ATTACK(ob1, ob2)

Defined in : <formulas.h>

Description: This macro will return take two objectpointers ob1 and ob2
	     as arguments and returns whether ob1 dares to attack ob2.
	     The return value is boolean, i.e. 1 or 0. Note that when
	     ob1 has the property NPC_I_NO_FEAR set, it will always dare
	     to attack.

Calculation: Normally, F_DARE_ATTACK will return true (1) when the average
	     stat of ob2 is not larger than twice the discipline of ob1.

	     ((ob2)->query_average_stat() <= ((ob1)->query_stat(SS_DIS) * 2))
