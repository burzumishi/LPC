* Defined in /sys/money.h

Macro:		MONEY_PARSE_OB(str, ob)

Description:	parses a string and returns an array of integersof the form
		({ cc, sc, gc, pc }).  Each element indicates how many coins
		of that type were specified by the parsed string.  Unlike
		MONEY_PARSE, -1 is not returned if all coins of a particular
		type are specified.  Instead, the object ob is searched for
		coins of that type, and the exact number of coins is used. If
		0 is returned, the string could not be parsed.

		For example, 
		MONEY_PARSE_OB("all silver coins and 3 gold coins", this_player())
		would return ({ 0, 20, 3, 0 }) (no copper, 20 silver, 3 gold,
		and no platinum coins), assuming this_player() possesses 20
		silver coins.

Arguments: 	(string) str - The string to be parsed
		(object) ob  - The object where the described coins can be
		               found
