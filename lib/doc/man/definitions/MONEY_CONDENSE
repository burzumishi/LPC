Macro   : MONEY_CONDENSE(obj)

Purpose : This macro will take the real coins inside the object 'obj' and
          condense them into a single property value, using the array form of
          the OBJ_M_HAS_MONEY property.          

Argument: (object) obj - the object to take all real coin objects from and
          store their composite values in the property.

Reverse : The macro MONEY_EXPAND(obj) has the reverse effect.

Warning : This macro is not meant to be used in domain code just like that.
          If you think you need to use it, please contact the mudlib team
          first to discuss it.
