*Defined in /sys/macros.h

QTNAME(ob)	VBFC that returns the name of ob or 'the' in front of the
		nonmet description depending if the object wich got the 
		message knows ob or not.
                (see /std/living/description.c: query_the_name).

		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.

                     This should never be used in a message directed to a
                     single target.  If the message is intended for a single
                     target, use a direct call to query_the_name() instead.
