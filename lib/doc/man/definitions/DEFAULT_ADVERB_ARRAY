Name       : string *DEFAULT_ADVERB_ARRAY

Defined in : /sys/adverbs.h

Description: This is the array with adverbs that are default.. They cannot be
             removed for the adverb-searching algorithm always needs at least
             two adverbs to function. There is no use in extending this
             array with all adverbs you know for that would make the dynamic
             system unnecessarily static.
