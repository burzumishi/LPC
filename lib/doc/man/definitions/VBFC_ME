Syntax     : VBFC_ME(string func)

OBSOLETE   : With the introduction of functionpointers, the definition VBFC_ME()
             became obsolete. It is only kept for backwards compatibility and
             for those few cases where functionpointers are not applicable.
             Where possible you should use a functionpointer.
