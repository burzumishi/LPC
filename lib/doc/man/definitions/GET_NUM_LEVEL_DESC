Definition : (string) GET_NUM_LEVEL_DESC(value, levels, descs)

Description: Find a description in an array based on levels, rather than
             spreading the descriptions uniformly over the range.
             Simply put: value >= levels[i] returns descs[i].

Arguments  : int value     - the value to transform to a description. If it is
                             below the lowest level, the first description is
                             returned.
             int *levels   - the levels in ascending order, associated
                             with the descriptions.
             string *descs - the descriptions, must be (at least) as many as
                             there are levels.

Returns    : string - the description associated with the value.
