Definition : (string) EXPAND_LINE(string text, int length)

Defined in : <composite.h>

Description: Returns a string of <length> long, padded with repetitions of
             <text>. This is especially meant for dynamic lines! The <text>
	     must be at least 1 character long. The last <text> may be
	     trunctated if it does not fit.
	     
             Note: To include a single quote "'" in the <text>, you must use
	     "\\'" (as the backslash has to be escaped past the interpreter).
	     Similarly, to include backslash "\" requires "\\\\".

Arguments  : string text - the text to use for padding. May not be empty "".
             int lenght  - the length of the string to fill.

Returns    : string - the string of length <length> padded with <text>.

Example    : EXPAND_LINE("+-", 5) -> "+-+-+"
