*Defined in /sys/macros.h

QTPNAME(ob)	VBFC that returns the possessive form of the name of ob or
		'the' in front of the possessive form of the nonmet
		description, if the object which got the knows ob or not,
		respectively.
                (see /std/living/description.c: query_the_possessive_name).

		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.

                     This should never be used in a message directed to a
                     single target.  If the message is intended for a single
                     target, use a direct call to query_the_possessive_name()
		     instead.
