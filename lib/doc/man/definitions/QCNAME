*Defined in /sys/composite.h

QCNAME(ob)	Works like QNAME but it returns the name or description of
		ob capitalized.
                (see /std/living/description.c: query_Art_name)

		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.

                     This should never be used in a message directed to a
                     single target.  If the message is intended for a single
                     target, use a direct call to query_Art_name() instead.
