LFUN's
======

In this man chapter some special functions within objects are commented. 

These so called lfuns are functions that are special in some sense. For 
information on the broad range of functions within objects in the standard
mudlib, i.e. files under /std /sys /cmd and /secure you are referred to
/doc/sman and the 'sman' command.

The lfuns which will actually be documented here are those that are actually
called by the mudlib directly, potentially in any object.

Documented lfuns are:
    create
    reset
    init

lfuns that need documented are:
    short
    long

    etc.
