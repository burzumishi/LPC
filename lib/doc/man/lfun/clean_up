NAME
	clean_up

DESCRIPTION
        This is a function that is called in all objects with
        regular interval. The object has basically three choices:

           1) Destruct itself.
           2) Return 0; Meaning call me again for possible clean_up.
           3) Return 1; Meaning Do not call me again, 'I will never destruct.'

        What you do with it is entirely up to you. The ONLY place that it is
        currently used in the mudlib is in /std/room.c. Rooms self-destruct if
        they are empty. If you want another behavior then make your own
        clean_up().
