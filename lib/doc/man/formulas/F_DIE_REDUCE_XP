Definition : F_DIE_REDUCE_XP(int exp)

Defined in : #include <formulas.h>

Description: When a player dies, then death will want his (un)fair share for
             his troubles. This macro will return the amount of experience to
	     remove. This is a linear percentage of the experience since we
	     must be able to use it on individual experience types as well as
	     the total experience.

Arguments  : int exp - the amount of experience death will take his share from.

Returns    : int - the amount of experience to be removed.
