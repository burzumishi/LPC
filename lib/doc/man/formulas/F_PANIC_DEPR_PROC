Formula    : F_PANIC_DEPR_PROC   -  depreciation percentage in formula.
             F_PANIC_DEPR_CONST  -  depreciation constant in formula.

Description: Simply put, panic depreciates exponentially as follows:

                 panic = panic * (1 - proc%) - const

             A small constant is subtracted to accellerate the depreciation,
             especially for low panic values. The percentage of depreciation
             is modified by the relative discipline of the player.

Example    : F_PANIC_DEPR_PROC = 4; F_PANIC_DEPR_CONST = 1;
             Player DIS = 60, average stat = 50, panic = 80

                 effective proc = 4% * 60/50 = 4.8%
                 new panic = 80 * 95.2% - 1 = 75.16 = 75
