Definition : F_DEATH_MIN_EXP_PLATFORM(int max_exp)

Defined in : #include <formulas.h>

Description: If someone is recovering from death, the actual brute applied is
             calculated with linear interpolation based on the current, minimum
	     and maximum experience the player ever had. Since the minimum exp
	     after death is not remembered, we need to calculate it from the
	     maximum a player had pre-death. Note that if a player died several
	     times, the actual exp may actually be lower than the minimum used
	     for interpolation. In that case the mininum applies.

Arguments  : int min_exp - the current max_exp value.

Returns    : int - the minimum exp below which the minimum brute is applied.
