NAME
        break - interupt/end a loop

SYNOPSYS
        break

DESCRIPTION
        The break statement will interrupt/end the current loop completely. It
        can stop for, foreach, switch or while statements.

EXAMPLE
        /* Print all even numbers from 1 till 10. Note that this particular
         * example can be done a lot more efficiently with a for-loop, but it
         * is just to demonstrate break and continue statements.
         */
        count = 1;
        while(1)
        {
            /* Skip the odd numbers, but don't terminate the loop. */
            if (count % 2 == 1) continue;

            /* More than 10, stop the loop completely. */
            if (count > 10) break;

            write(count);
            count++
        }
