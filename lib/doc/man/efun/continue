NAME
        continue - skip the rest of this round of the loop

SYNOPSYS
        continue

DESCRIPTION
        The continue statement will skip the rest of the current round of
        a loop and go to the next round. It works on for, foreach or while
        statements.

EXAMPLE
        /* Print all even numbers from 1 till 10. Note that this particular
         * example can be done a lot more efficiently with a for-loop, but it
         * is just to demonstrate break and continue statements.
         */
        count = 1;
        while(1)
        {
            /* Skip the odd numbers, but don't terminate the loop. */
            if (count % 2 == 1) continue;

            /* More than 10, stop the loop completely. */
            if (count > 10) break;

            write(count);
            count++
        }
