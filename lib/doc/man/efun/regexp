NAME
        regexp - match a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
        string *regexp(string *array, string pattern)

DESCRIPTION
        Regexp is short for regular expression and it is a general way of
        matching string used frequently in unix. The funcion regexp in lpc
        tries to match all strings in the array against a regular expression
        contained in the string exp and return all strings that matched.
        This function can sometimes replace a filter() operation and should
        do so as it is much faster. Here is a short summary of regexps.

        ONE CHAR MATCHES:
        'c'     Matches the character c.
        '.'     Matches any character.
        '[abc]' Matches one of the characters a, b or c.
        '[^ab]' Matches any character _but_ a or b.

        MULTIPLE CHAR MATCHES: ( 'c' can be any of the one char matches. )
        'c*'    Matches a sequence of zero or more of the character c.
        'c+'    Matches a sequence of one or more of the character c.

        MISC
        '^'     Matches the beginning of the string.
        '$'     Matches the end of the string.

        More information can be found in the unix or emacs documentation.
