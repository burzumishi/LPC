NAME
	catch - catch an execution error

DESCRIPTION
	mixed catch(mixed expr)

DESCRIPTION
	Evaluate 'expr'. If there is no error, 0 is returned. If there is a 
	standard error, a string (with a leading '*') will be returned.

	The function throw(value) can also be used to immediately return any
	value, except 0. catch() is not really a function call, but a
	directive to the compiler.

	The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used anywhere.
	Rather, use it at places where and error would destroy consistency.
