NAME
	call_other - call a function in another object
	
SYNOPSIS
	mixed call_other(object ob|string ob, string func, ...)
	mixed <object ob>|<string ob>-><func>(<...>)
	
	mapping <mapping m>-><func>(<...>)
	array <array m>-><func>(<...>)
DESCRIPTION
	This function is used to call another function in a given
	object. If the object `ob' is given as a string the object
	is found using "find_object()", otherwise the object pointer
	is used directly. If the object is given as a string, the
	absolute path to the object must be given.

	`func' should simply be the name of the function to be called.
	Any number of arguments to the function can be added to the
	call.

	Example:

	name = call_other(find_player("commander"), "query_real_name");
	access = call_other("/secure/master", "valid_read", 
		"/DONE", "commander", "my_func");

	"call_other()" can also be performed using "->" with this syntax:

	name = find_player("commander")->query_real_name();
	access = "/secure/master"->valid_read("/DONE", "commander", 
							"my_func");

	An extended form of call_other is when a mapping or an array
	takes the place of the object argument. The types of the array
	elements or mapping values should be object or string. If an
	array is used, the function "func" will be called in every object
	in the array, and the returned value will be an array of the return
	values from the function calls.
	If a mapping is used, a mapping with the original indexes and the
	resulting values from the function call will be returned.
	
	Example:
	
	int *arr;
	arr = users()->query_wiz_level();
