NAME
	wildmatch

SYNOPSIS
	int wildmatch(string pattern, int|string subject)

DESCRIPTION
	wildmatch will return 1 if the `subject' matches the `pattern'.
	The patterns used by wildmatch are similar to those used in file
	name matching by UNIX shells.
	If the second argument is an int (or 0 string), it returns 0.

	Most characters match only themselves in the pattern,
	but the following are special:
		*	- matches any number of any characters.
		?	- matches any characters.
		[xyz]	- matches any characters in xyz.
		[^xyz]	- matches any characters not in xyz.
		\c	- matches c even if c is special. Notice that within a
                          string you must use \\ to get a single \ in the
                          pattern. See the examples.

	Examples:
		wildmatch("*.foo", "bar.foo") == 1
		wildmatch("*.foo", "foo.bar") == 0
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "axy") == 1
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "dxy") == 0
		wildmatch("[abc]?*", "a") == 0
                wildmatch("\\*a*", "*abc") == 1
                wildmatch("\\*a*", "xabc") == 0
