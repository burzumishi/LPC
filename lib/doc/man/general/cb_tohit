Combat aid
===========

1) 
  All specials where possible shall use the mudlib function cb_tohit
  or a similar construct to determine it the special hits or not.

2) 
  The 50% reduction for a special which uses a skill is now removed
  and replaced with a 50% increase in combat aid for specials whos
  effectiveness is not based off a guild skill.

3) 
  All damage specials hit percentage are now taken into consideration
  of calculating combat aid.  The to_hit value used for cb_tohit will
  give you how much the special can be reduced using this chart:

tohit value  hit %    combat aid reduction
   0          0%           100%   (will never hit)
   5          4%            96%
  10          9%            91%
  15          14%           86%
  20          18%           82%
  25          23%           77%
  30          28%           72%
  35          33%           67%
  40          37%           63%
  45          42%           58%
  50          48%           52%
  55          52%           48%
  60          57%           43%
  65          62%           38%
  70          66%           34%
  75          71%           29%
  80          75%           25%
  85          78%           22%
  90          82%           18%
  95          84%           16%
 100          87%           13%
 105          89%           11%
 110          90%           10%

  To hit values will be rounded UP to the nearest value on the
  chart... so if your to_hit value is 66 it will use the 70 value
  on the chart.

  The chart above was generated by doing numerous tests of the cb_tohit
  function testing against another living with equal skills and stats.
  It should be a realistic reflection on what the tohit value gives in
  combat aid.

4) 
  If a special does not use cb_tohit it shall be considered a 100%
  hit value and thus given no tax break, no matter what checks are made.
