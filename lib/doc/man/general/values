This is a documentation of the values of some examplified items. This is
meant as a guideline for setting values on things.

The monetary system is based on the number 12. It is rumored that this is
because gnomes have six fingers / hand although this is dubious.

There is 12 copper coins on a silver coin, 12sc on a gold coin and 12gc
on a platinum coin. All values are given in copper below.

There is one golden rule for values:

     -------------------------------------------------------------	
	 Nothing is more valuable than Fatty's weight in gold.
     -------------------------------------------------------------	

Below is the list of value formulas for specific items in copper coins:

Weapons                 20 + (wchit * wcpen)
Armours			20 + (ac * (21 + ac) / 3)
Liqour healing          10 + (alco * alco / 10)
Food			 5 + (amount * amount / 600)
Magic object healing    5 * hp + hp * hp / 4
Magic spell healing
 (cost of component)    hp * 20

  Backpack               350cc  
  Healpotion 50hp        875cc
  Healing component 40hp 800cc (Typically pulverized gemstones)
	

All prices can of course vary depending on quality, beauty, ornamentation etc.

Note also that the most common coins are copper and silver. Gold and
especially platinum is very rare and should not be traded with generally.
In other words, banks and shops accepts gold and platinum gladly but are
_very_ reluctant to hand it out.

Note that even though armours seem a lot cheaper than weapons, this is
more or less an illusion for ac and wc less than 30. This is so because
in normal combat only one weapon is used but 7-8 armours. This will
effectively multiply the armour cost with a factor of 7-8.
