PRAGMAS

Pragmas are instructions to the LPC compiler. the following can be defined:

strict_types	The compiler will apply strict typechecking to the entire
		file (and included files).

save_binary	The result of the compilation will be saved to a file, so
		that the object doesn't have to be recompiled next time
		it is loaded. If a new gamedriver is installed, all files
		will be recompiled before they are loaded. If a file is
		changed, this will be detected by the gamedriver, and a
		recompilation will be performed.

no_clone	It will not be possible to make clones of the object.

no_inherit	The file can not be inherited.

no_shadow	The file cannot be shadowed. This includes the inability to
		call static functions by inheriting objects.

resident	The object will never be swapped to disk.
