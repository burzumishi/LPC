Introduction
============

This text describes 'Madwands', the wizards that have not played themselves
to wizardhood the normal way, but instead have become promoted to wizards
to allow them to contribute with their coding skills at once.

Each Lord has the right to draft one such Madwand to his domain.


Background
==========

To force players to go through a long, to some very boring, period of
playing before becoming wizards makes us lose some very good coders, they
simply give up or, knowing the rules, never even start playing. 

Most of the time this is good, only the really interested people invests
the time it takes to play a character to wizhood. For some specific people
it is however very bad, bad for Genesis because we loose a lot of creative
power.

Therefore the right is given to the Lord of each domain to draft one
'instawiz'. This should not be the lords best friend. It should be someone
with exceptionally good coding skills and an ambition to contribute and
invest a lot of time in the creation of the world of Genesis.


Drafting and expelling
======================

Madwands are drafted by the 'promote' command and expelled with the 'expel'
command. See help on these. Arches and Keepers can also use the 'draft'
command to draft a specific mortal as Madwand to a specific domain.

A mortal promoted to 'Madwand' gets his playerfile saved so as if he is 
expelled he will get restored to his pre-madwand status. This differs
from demoted wizards that get to start from scratch again.


Mudlib support
==============

Madwands are normal wizards in all respects and can be any level as long
as they are members of a domain. Each domain has registred which of its
members, if any, that is a Madwand. 

The 'Madwand' is not an extra member in the domain. If the domain is full
but has no Madwand, it is still full and no Madwand can be drafted.

Information of who is a Madwand and if a domain has one, is given through 
the 'finger' command. This applies both to wizards and domains. All
Madwands will also have their title prepended with 'the Madwand of Domain'
by default.


Terminology
===========

The term 'Madwand' is from Roger Zelasny's book 'Wizard World', and denotes
a wizard that has not gone through proper education and training but has
still learnt and to some extent mastered the craft on his or her own.

A potential 'Madwand' ought to have spent some time playing on Genesis to
get a feel of the surroundings and the world. Any such demands are up to
the judgement of the Lords. It is after all they who are fully responsible.
Each Lord for his Madwand.
