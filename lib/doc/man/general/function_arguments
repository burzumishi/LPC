VARARGS

If one defines a function with '...' as last argument it will define the
variable argv which will contain all argumants passed to the function past
the last declared, this means access to true varargs syntax.

DEFAULT VALUES
It is possible to give default values to arguments of functions.
If a value for the argument isn't supplied when the function is
called it will have the default value.

Example:
    int present_player(object where = previous_object())

Then if present_player is called without arguments, "where" will have
the value previous_object().

INITIAL VALUES
You can give variables initial values when you declare them, both
on the global level and inside a function.
