This document describes how people earn xp in 3.0


Background
==========

In older versions there were two problems with the xp system:

	- It promoted hack'n slash type playing
	- It was artificial to 'buy' levels with xp and money.

The first problem was more or less solved by introducing quests. These were
seen as an artificial way to make it harder to become wiz. There were no
real motivation to why you had to do quests.

In 3.0 both this problems are dealt with.


Quest type experience and combat experience
===========================================

The total amount of xp gained from combat is stored in the player. When gaining
xp a special flag denotes that the xp is gained through combat. When this flag
is true, the xp gained is REDUCED by a factor equal to combat_xp/total_xp
ratio of the player. This is the so called 'brute factor'.

This means that a player who only gains xp from combat will find himself
getting less and less for each fight. To truly learn more and get more
experienced he will have to go questing. 

Note that xp gained from quests are not reduced by the 'brute factor'. Note
also that after some quest xp is gained, it can be rewarding to fight again.

This removes the explicit demand to solve a certain number of quests. 


Stats instead of levels, learning instead of buying
===================================================

The second problem was the artificial system of buying levels. The levelsystem
is replaced by a number of stats in 3.0. These stats reflects the players
experience and matureness in for example: Strength, Wisdom, Disciplin

These stats are not bought, a player can 'meditate' before adventuring and 
thereby telling himself which stats he will concentrate in learning (raising).
When xp is gained the stats are raised reflecting these 'mental settings'.

Note that money has no effect on these stats.


Presentation of xp
==================

The player are never given a numeric value for his experience. The player
should have no concept of experience points as such, only a description of
how strong, intelligent, wise etc the player is. The only numerals presented
to the player are the %-values of the 'mental settings'. These can, after
proper preparation, be set to numbers between 0-100. The sum equal to or less
than 100 of course.


Using the new xp system
=======================

To add experience to a player simply call: add_exp(amount, combat_flag)

If combat_flag is true the xp will be considered gained in combat and therefore
reduced by the 'brute factor' it will also be added to the total amount of
combat_xp in the player, which is used to calculate the 'brute factor'.

Quest type experience should not be repeatedly given for doing the same thing
over and over again. Use random changes in your minor quests to make them
nonrepeatable.

For larger quests there is a set of 'quest flags' in the player. The right to
these can be applied for and then used to store information on if a player has
done a certain quest before or not. See 'quest_bits' and 'make_wizard'

To get quest bits, talk to your domain lord.
