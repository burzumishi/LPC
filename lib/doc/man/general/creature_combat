This file documents the how to make generic nonhumanoid creatures and how the
combat system works for them.

There is basically two different types of creatures:

	- Tool users
		These are nonhumanoid creatures that still use weapons
		and armours. These tools can be entirely or partially
		incompatible with humanoids. 
	
	- Non tool users
		These are normally animals that have no concept of tools
		and fight with what they were born with, things like
		fangs, claws and a tough skin.

Tool users normally use the combat object: /std/combat/ctool.c
This is the generic version of the humanoid combat object.
