The LPmud game is very complex. Virtually any situation or idea may be
put into code. Because of this there have to be rules that define what
a wizard may do and what he/she may not do.

Since the potential of the game is so great, we have endeavoured to
separate the rules into sections that relate to just a single subject.
However, there are some general rules relating to all wizards that
can't be put solely into one of these subjects. They relate to all and
all must follow them. It is those rules you will find in this section.

Rules for all wizards
=====================

When you became a wizard, the game as such came to an end. Accept
that now and you will have no trouble in the future. You are no
longer a part of the ordinary quest for experience and should have
no such contact with the game in the future. Should you ever decide
that being a wizard is no longer your preference, your wizard
character will be removed and the name _banished_. This is a 
necessity caused by domain logging and the prevention of interaction
of mortals with former wizards.

A wizard may not help or harass a player in the game. The only help a
wizard may offer is information on how to play the game, i.e. how the
mechanics of the game work, which commands are available etc. Hints
on quests, where to find equipment etc is expressly forbidden. Any
restorations or modifications of experience or equipment etc should be
handled by the Archwizards or those who act with the permission of the
Archwizards. Socializing is acceptable only if it is made on the terms
of the mortal in question. Their right to privacy and enjoyment of the
game must be respected.

A wizard in a domain may not switch domains without the approval of
an Archwizard and the current and future Lieges, so choose wisely
if you are seeking a domain. Generally, this will be no problem, as
we encourage people to code what they believe they will have the 
most fun with, but there are instances where it is undesirable for
a wizard to "skip ship" so to speak.

All wizards have a test character available in the game. The name of
that test character is usually the same as the wizard but with a "jr"
appended. You can log this test character on as soon as you become
wizard by using the same password as your normal character. If there
should be a need for more than one test character, be certain to make
him immediately identifiable as a testcharacter by his name. This
testcharacter must be played as if he were a wizard, with the same
rules applying to him. A wizard may not introduce a "test wizard".
All test characters must be mortals. 

You are supposed to use your test character to test out any code you
produce before making it available to the mortals. On _NO_ account may
you invite a mortal to test your area. This invariably ends with the
mortal being killed, losing equipment and you getting demoted for
carelessness.

All code produced must be of benefit to the game. A wizard may not write
code that is intended to harass another player or wizard. Code that
is intended to be of use to only a small number of people, like wizard
tools or special wizard rooms should be kept to an absolute minimum.
Be sure that you can motivate it before writing it. Ego-inflating code
like unique wizard-weaponry or armour etc is not allowed. We can use
the diskspace in a far more productive way even if you can't.

The game is set in "the long distant past". Because of this all
descriptions and messages of _any_ kind in the game should give the
player the feeling of a medieval setting. There simply may not exist
anything that even remotely sounds modern, not even in places where a
mortal never may see it.

An important final point: remember your creative responsibility. You are 
the one immediately responsible for the code you create, although you will 
also get your liege into trouble if you don't invest the necessary care 
in your creations. In return for being granted your wizard powers, you 
are expected to:

          -  stay properly acquainted with the rules,
          -  test code thoroughly,
          -  document code clearly,
          -  properly maintain code in the period after it is open,
          -  periodically review code as your skills improve.

Generally if you code as a long-term investment it will pay big dividends
to you and the rest of the mud, not least because it will increase the 
chances of your work standing the test of time and being kept in the game 
after you are gone. 

Breaking of rules
=================

Generally if you break a rule this leads just to a warning and the
demotion of one or more levels. Remember though, that continual rule-
breaking will lead to demotion to mortal, and banishment of the name
you once possessed.

If the offense is considered to have been sheer hooliganism you might
be expelled from the game entirely. In case of such a drastic action,
the Archwizards must also consider possible actions of revenge from
you and they might deem it necessary to exclude your site entirely
from the game. 

Specific rules for the game
===========================

All rules concerning the game may be found in /doc/man/general/ and
/doc/man/Genesis/. It's a very good idea to read through them all once
just to get an idea of what is allowed and not. Later when you want to
add things to the game you can read through the relevant files more 
carefully. Remember that not knowing about a rule is _no_ excuse for
breaking it.
