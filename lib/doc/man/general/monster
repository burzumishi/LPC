This file documents some specific details about making monsters. 


Description
===========

Monsters are essentially NPC's. This means that they have almost all the
qualities of a normal player including a lot of commands such as
emotions and object manipulation. They are also included among creatures
that players can be introduced to.

This means that monsters are different from ordinary object with respect
to their shortdescription. 

You can of course define your own short() to do this. Normally monsters are
identified by three things:

	- Their actual name (Some monsters might not have a name)
	- Their race name
	- Any number of adjectives

Normally a player have not been introduced to a monster and the short() will
therefore be: 'adj adj adj race_name'

To ensure that a monster is never introduced you can add a special property,
(see properties/living), called LIVE_I_NEVERKNOWN

This is especially usefull for animals which really has no specific name.
