It is very popular among wizards to make mazes, but players generally hate
mazes since they are boring and feel like an utter waste of time.

To put a stop to the abuse of mazes, you are not allowed to produce a new
maze without the explicit premission from a keeper (arch won't do).
Don't expect permission without a truly novel idea.
