A players stats are a direct function of the amount of xp gathered for
a specific stat, see 'experience'. Note that the player decides what
stats to 'practice', xp are not given separately for each stat. The 
division takes place internally within a player.

A stat of 100 is equivalent to 1.000.000 xp. This means that a player will
need on the average 6.000.000 xp to become wizard.

There is one basic rule for giving xp on solving quests above questlevel 0:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   You may not give more xp for a quest than the player already has.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that players start with an average of 10 in all stats, giving mortals
a base xp of around 6000 xp.

Here are some examples of differently sized quests and how much normal
xp to give. Treat these as size examples and not at all by content. The idea
is to let your imagination fly :-)

     1 -     50 -Touristing  - 'I was there before Kilroy' 
		A very small 'quest'. Normally simply to find some specific
       (0)	location. Should not take a long time nor be difficult.
		Used for utter novices to get around a bit and see the
		different parts of the mud.

    50 -    100 -Serious tourist - 'Exploring is fun, mind the details'
		A small 'quest'. Might be to locate a specific object 
       (0)	somewhere. Might take some thought but shouldn't be
		dangerous.

   100 -   1000 -The minor assignment - 'I am a true adventurer!'
		Should actually solve something, might be to slay the nasty
		wolf plaguing the farmers in the village, solve a riddle or
       (1)	bring back some treasure or specific object. Can be both
		difficult and dangerous for beginners.

  1000 -  10000 -Small adventure - 'Be bold and prosper!'
		This is a small scale quests, maybe in some stages, might take
       (2)	some time and be both dangerous and/or difficult for the
	        not so well prepared.
 
 10000 -  50000 -Major adventure - 'This comes to be an occupation, brothers!'
		Should take some time and serious thinking, might well
       (3)	demand team work and cooperation. Could be in a couple of
		stages and be quite a challange.

 50000 - 100000 -Normal quests - 'Brothers in arms, roaming the world'
                These are the normal quests, mostly solved by an
       (4)	experienced team of adventurers. There can be many types
	  	of difficulties and dangers. These are never easy to solve
		and should include challanges to both mind and muscle.

100000 - 900000 -The Ultimate Quests - 'Behold the mighty!'
                This is the quests for the 'soon to be wizards'. Here are
		the true mights in the world revelead together with the
       (5)	challanges and difficulties that make a true LPmud quest.
		There is usually only one such quest/domain and it is the
		true brainchild and effort of the domain set in code.

The numbers in paranthesis indicates questlevel. This is used to decide
the maximum rewards when solving the quest. (see weapon and armour)

The actual amount of xp delivered might be made to depend on a lot of things,
the truly nice quests are the ones where the player gets more xp for a
more brilliant solution. Fooling NPC's might be better than killing them.

Normal xp's are not shared. Each player should get the relevant amount of xp
for taking part in solving the quest. It is only combat xp which is given
in a specific amount when a monster is killed which is split among players.

Some important points to notice:

	- Demand that the difficulty in the quest not be able to be handled
	  by one teammember alone. An utter novice should not be able to
	  solve an ultimate quest just because he is a member of an
	  experienced team. It could of course count as a minor adventure
	  for the novice, use common sense ;-)

	- Use stages. It is more rewarding to solve part by part than 
	  getting all the xp reward in a cataclysmic ending.

	- Document the quest bits used. Once assigned for a purpose that
	  purpose can not be changed.

	- Quests of level 0-4 are the responsibility of the Lord of the domain,
	  the ultimate quest, level 5, must be acknowledged by the Arch of
          Balance or by a Keeper. If a Keeper acknowledges the quest, the
          Arch of Balance must be informed of the decision.

And the ONE rule again:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   You may not give more xp for a quest than the player already has.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
