We all like to code shops, banks, traders and all sorts of things
handling money but there are some rules and recommendations to
follow.

Remember that there is a trading skill. Please consider it and
let players with high skill get better deals, some %. There is
also nothing wrong to let players of different races or different
guilds get some % better or worse deals. I don't think dwarves 
and elves never understood eachother, perhaps elves won't even
trust dwarves in their shops or banks? Be creative :)


Shops
=====

It has to be more expensive for the players to buy stuff from a
shop than for the shop to buy it from the player (i.e. sell). Yes
I have seen shops where there were no difference :( 

A standard shop shall not give out any gold nor platinum and
should demand the player to pay twice the value of the goods
when buying. Also a standard shop should not give out more than
1000 cc (copper coins) for one item.

Standard shops shall note have an inventory that exceeds thirty items.
The module /lib/store_support.c must be inherited in store rooms to take
care of this.

Bank
====

If you have a bank where players can deposit their money you should
let them pay for it, not give them intrest or anything like that.

When changing money at a standard bank should take a fee of
20% of the value of the transaction. How you want them to pay is up
to you just as long as you make them pay *grin* .
Remember that if you change all your copper coins to platinum coins
you will have lowered the weight you are carrying up to 1728 times!
That ought to be worth something ??
