This file documents the humanoid specific parts of the combat system. For
the description of the generic combat system, read 'combat'. You are
recommended to read 'combat' before reading this file.

Humanoid combat is an example of combat that is tool enhanced. Being
'humanoid' also means that you get a set of default attacks and hitlocations.
These are defined in /sys/wa_types.h

	Attacks:		
		right fist, left fist, joined hands, left foot,	right knee

	Hit locations:
		head, left arm,	right arm, body, legs

There is two different combat objects that is used for humanoid combat:

	/std/combat/humanoid.c
		This is the 'open' object. With this new attacks and hit-
		locations can be added.

	/std/combat/chumlock.c
		This is the 'closed' object. No new attacks or hitlocations
		can be added.

Both these objects inherits the generic 'tool' combat object,
 /std/combat/ctool.c which is described below:

	- ctool inherits cbase and therefore work more or less like it,
	  see 'combat' for description of cbase. It is however extended
	  with the concept of combat tools.
