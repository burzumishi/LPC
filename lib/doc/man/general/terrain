TERRAINS - Types and use.
=========================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is an explanation of the various defines for terrain types.

TERRAIN_OUTSIDE - This is used simply to define whether a room is outside
	or inside. This is one of the basic defines the entire terrain system
	terrain system is based on. To define a room as outside, it must meet
        several criteria: - it must not be significantly walled in
                          - if it is walled in, it must have little to no
                            ceiling, and thus exposed to the sun and 
                            sky/water above.

TERRAIN_NATURAL - This is used to determine whether the environment of
	this room is natural or artificial/constructed in origin. Does the
	room have features that were created by nature, or does it have
	something that was built? A hilltop with glacial rocks would be
	natural, while ruins on the hilltop would be artificial.

TERRAIN_UNDERWATER - This define will denote terrains that are under the
	surface of a water body, be it a lake, ocean or well.

TERRAIN_ONWATER - This type is to be used for rooms in which the person
	is swimming in the water, or a boat is floating on the water, but
	is not entirely submerged.

TERRAIN_INAIR - This type is to be used for rooms that do not have any
	ground to stand on. The best example is a room in the sky.

TERRAIN_UNDERGROUND - This type is to be used for caverns, mines, dungeons,
	and such that are below the surface of the realms.

TERRAIN_CURRENT - This type is to be used if there is a significant
	current in the water environment the player is swimming in,
        or a strong wind in the air where the player is moving.
	Having this terrain type might make it harder to move.

TERRAIN_ONVEHICLE - This terrain type is to be used for areas that are
        mobile in the environment. This includes boats, stagecoaches,
        dragons etc.

TERRAIN_OPENSPACE - This define is to be used for areas that allow much
	freedom of movement. To use it properly, many variables must be
	considered, such as room dimension and clutter. This pivotal
	define can be used for many things: - range weapons allowable
                                            - absence can mean that certain
                                              special attacks won't work
                                            - whether a horse can move
                                              into the room or not

Temperatures are defined as using 3 of the bits available. This gives
us 8 temperatures to choose from. If not selected, temperate is assumed.

TERRAIN_MELTING - The area is so hot that the ground has melted or
        in the case of water, that it is boiling.
TERRAIN_HOT - The area is so hot that it is difficult to survive for
        long periods of time. This may be in a desert, by a furnace etc.
TERRAIN_WARM - The climate is tropical.
TERRAIN_TEMPERATE - The climate is normal. This is also normal indoor climate.
TERRAIN_COOL - The climate is cool, like in a cavern.
TERRAIN_COLD - The climate is cold, like a stormy autumn night.
TERRAIN_FREEZING - Water turns to snow and ice.
TERRAIN_BITTER_COLD  - Unprotected people freeze to death in a matter
        of minutes.

TERRAIN_LARGE - This terrain type is used mostly to differentiate some
	of the more complex terrain types (a lake to a pond for example).

TERRAIN_IMPURE - This type is to be used if the environment contains
	salt water, sulphuric air or some other foreign substance.

TERRAIN_WET - This type is to be used if the area is 'wet'. It doesn't
	necessarily have to contain water, or any readily apparent
	liquid at all, but it should contain something wet, like saturated
	soil.

TERRAIN_ROCK - This type is to be used if the substrate of the ground 
	is hard. It is used for rocky ground, wooden floors, stone flagging.

TERRAIN_SAND - This type is to be used if the substrate of the ground 
	is sandy. It should be possible to pick up handfuls of sand from
	places with this terrain type.

TERRAIN_SOIL - This type is to be used if the substrate of the ground has
	a fair amount of soil.

TERRAIN_CLUTTER - This type is to be used if the area is cluttered,
	or filled with items, even if they are only add_items in the
	room description. It might make it more possible to hide.

TERRAIN_TALL_PLANT - This type is to be used if the environment contains
        trees, or other vegetation that is taller than any player.
	A possibility might exist to have a default 'climbable' tree in
	these types of terrains, just to add some flavour.

TERRAIN_SMALL_PLANT - This shows if the terrain contains bushes, grass,
        kelp, or equivalent. The property may be used to see if you can
        graze steeds or if there is a possibility of finding herbs.

TERRAIN_MUD - This terrain type is the combination of TERRAIN_WET and
	TERRAIN_SOIL. If both are present, it should be able to collect
	mud.

TERRAIN_ROUGH - This type is to be used for areas that are difficult to
	travel through, whether by swimming or walking.

TERRAIN_STEEP - This type is to be used also for areas that are difficult
	to travel through, but instead are at an incline rather than
	flat or horizontal.

TERRAIN_SHADOWS - This type controles if it is esy to hide, if there
        is a lightsource present. Alleys and ruins are typical of this 
        type, that can be used to increase the effectiveness of hide and sneak.

TERRAIN_CROWDED - This type is to be used for areas that have many people
	or other inhabitants. In areas that are crowded, it should of
	course be easier to steal, but far more difficult to hide or
	sneak. It should also be difficult to maneuver effectively.

TERRAIN_RESIDENCE - This terrain is to be used for areas that are
	domiciles, lairs, habitations, and houses.

TERRAIN_HASDEAD - This type is to be used in areas that have, or have
	historically had, many dead. This would include ancient
	battlefields, graveyards and tombs.
