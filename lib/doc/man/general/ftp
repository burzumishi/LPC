FTP   File Transfer Protocol
============================

FTP is a standard protocol for the transfer of files between computers
that are connected by a network. Rather than using the ed-editor to
create/edit files, you might want to have your files locally to examine
them, create new files or edit existing ones. For this purpose, FTP will
be available on most LPmud's.

To use FTP, you need to have a so-called FTP-client. These types of
programs are available for most types of operating systems, though can be
very basic in some cases. Other FTP-clients can be more extensive and
offer you more. The operation can be very different for command-driven or
windows-driven clients. This guide will therefore only deal with some of
the basic commands and concepts.

To begin a session, you have to start you client. Most clients accept
the site you want to connect to as commandline parameter. Otherwise, or
if you are already in the client, you can <open> a new connection. The
connection should be opened to the same site as you use to enter the
game, without the port-number! Your login name is '<wizname>' and you
can use your LPmud password to gain access.

When you are connected and logged in, your path will be set to your
home directory (example: /w/commander) if you are a wizard. Through FTP,
you have the same read and write rights as you have as a wizard in the game.

EXAMPLE
=======

Note to use port 1821 for FTP; to connect to the LPmud host:

        ftp genesis.tekno.chalmers.se 1821

Your wizard user name and password are to be used for ftp too. You should not
use 'lpmud:' as was the case in the past. When you get access, you can use the
commands described above to download or upload files.

COMMANDS
========

It is not guaranteed that these commands are also supported by the FTP-
client that you are using, but you are likely to find them on most FTP-
programs.

ftp <site> [<port>]	start the FTP-program and if added, try to connect
			to the site <site> at port <port>. Note that some
			clients require a colon between <site> and <port>.

open <site>		connect to a new site (don't add a port-number)
			if you are already running the FTP-program
user <wizname>		if you connected, but make a mistake with your
			login name or password, you can retry to login
			without having to re-connect
help / ?		get help on how to use your FTP-program
ls / dir		list the directory contents on the remote machine
cd <directory>		change to another directory on the remote machine
get <filename>		transfer a remote file to your local machine
put <filename>		transfer a local file to the remote host
!<command>		while you are connected, perform a local command
lcd <directory>		change the directory on your local machine
close			close the connection
bye / quit		leave the FTP-program

TROUBLESHOOTING / WARNING
=========================

It may happen that the remote host refuses to display the contents of a
directory or refuses access to get or put a file. UNIX (the operating
system the LPmud runs on) uses 9 property bits for read, write and
execute for various users. If you get a refusal, those bits may not
be set properly. To set those properties, you can use the following
command:

quote site chmod 666 <filespec>

In this, <filespec> can be a path or filename. Generally, you can use the
period "." to indicate that you want to modify the properties of the
current directory and all files in it.

ADDITIONAL COMMANDS / INFORMATION
=================================

The commands get and put usually do not allow you to use wildcards. To
FTP several files might require many commands. Three commands may help
you in this case:

mget <filespec>		transfer one or more files from the remote host
			to your local machine
mput <filespec>		transfer one or more files from your local
			machine to the remote host.
prompt			if you are promted for each file individually,
			you may disable/enable prompting with this
			command

If you want to get a copy of the complete mudlib, rather than FTPing the
files from the LPmud host, you may FTP it in one archived file, a
so-called TAR-file. To get it, connect via FTP to ftp.cd.chalmers.se and
somewhere in the /public directory, you will find the mudlib with all
documentation that goes with it. The gamedriver can also be obtained from
that same site.

The same thing applies to acquiring a copy of all code in your domain or
a large portion of that code, for instance a complete area. Rather than
FTP-ing this bulk of files yourself, you might politely ask a member of
the administration with access to the local host to make a TAR for you to
FTP and unpack locally. This will only be done in special occasions and
requires the approval of your domain Liege! This file most certainly does
not mean that you have a right to such a TAR, but it only suggests the
possibility since it is totally up to the (kindness of) administration of
your LPmud game to provide such facility.
