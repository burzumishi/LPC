Healing can be differentiated into three categories. If you manage 
to think of something that doesn't immediately fit into any of these
categories, put it in "Magic healing by objects".

Liquor
======

These objects should be created by inheriting or cloning the standard
object "/std/liquor.c". The standard value of this object in copper 
coins is calculated with the formula: 

	cc = 10 + (alco * alco / 10)
	
Where 'alco' is the amount of intoxication the object heals. This value
is automatically given to the object unless a higher value is specified.

The object may not have a higher 'alco' value than 50. 

A domain may produce a maximum of 1000 hp of healing per reset and
wizard in that domain. No player should be allowed to buy more than
a total 500 hp healing per reset.


Magic healing by objects (potions, talismans etc)
========================

A domain may produce a maximum of 100 hp of healing per reset and
wizard in that domain. This kind of magic should be relatively hard to
obtain and not for sale in just any shop. Typically such objects could
be rewards in quests, or maybe just available to members of certain
guild. The healing objects should have a minimum value of 

	cc = 5 * hp + (hp ^ 2) / 4

Where 'hp' is the number of hitpoints the object heals.

Magic healing by spells
=======================

The conversion cost of spellpower should be 1 hp = 2 sp. Also, a 
material component equal to the number of hitpoints healed * 20 cc
should be consumed in the process.
