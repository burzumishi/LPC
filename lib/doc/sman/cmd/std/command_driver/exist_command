(nomask public int) exist_command(string verb)
/* 
 * Function name: exist_command
 * Description  : Check if a command exists. Actually this function returns
 *                an integer value that can be larger than 1 too, but since
 *                the result is only dereferenced as true/false, that is
 *                not a problem. Changing the value to a strict 1/0 would
 *                only cost time.
 * Returns      : int - 1/0 depending on success.
