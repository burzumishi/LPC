(void) appraise_object(int num)
/*
 * Function name: appraise_object
 * Description  : When you inherit /lib/holdable_item.c you MUST also define
 *                the function appraise_object() as copy of this function. It
 *                MUST make the call to appraise_holdable_item() as well. If
 *                you omit this, then the player will not be able to appraise
 *                this item properly.
 *                PS: This is just a dummy function. It does not exist. You
 *                    must write your own as copy of this one.
 * Arguments    : int num - the semi-randomised appraise skill.
