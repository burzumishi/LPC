(public void) leave_env(object from, object to)
/*
 * Function name: leave_env
 * Description  : When you inherit /lib/wearable_item.c into any object other
 *                than /std/armour.c you MUST also define the function
 *                leave_env() as copy of this function. It MUST make the
 *                call to wearable_item_leave_env(from, to) as well. If
 *                you omit this, then the item will not be automatically
 *                removed when the player drops it, for instance.
 *                PS: This is just a dummy function. It does not exist. You
 *                    must write your own as copy of this one.
 * Arguments    : object from - the environment we are leaving.
 *                object to   - the environment we are entering.
