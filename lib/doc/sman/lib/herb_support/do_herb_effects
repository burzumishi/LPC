/* 
 * Function: do_herb_effects
 * Description: In this function the effect(s) of the herb are resolved.
 *              To define a standard effect, do 
 *              set_effect(herb_type, str, strength); in create_herb(),
 *              where herb_type is one of the herb-types in /sys/herb_types.h,
 *              str is a string for the affect type, and strength is an
 *              integer for the strength of the effect.
 *              Read /doc/man/general/herbs for more information.
 *              One effect per herb should be the norm, but adding one or
 *              two is ok, as long as they don't make the herb too good.
