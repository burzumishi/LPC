(int) mkcompare_util(function f, function compare_fun, mixed x, mixed y)
/*
 * Function name: mkcompare_util
 * Description:   Compare two items and return a value meaningful for
 *                sort_array() (that is, 1, 0, or -1).
 * Arguments:     function f            - If specified, the comparison values
 *                                        will be derived by calling this
 *                                        function rather than simply comparing
 *                                        items directly.
 *                function compare_func - A function that determines how the
 *                                        items will be compared.  This is
 *                                        typically &operator(<)().
 *                mixed x               - The first item to compare.
 *                mixed y               - The second item to compare.
 * Returns:       1, 0, or -1, as determined by compare_func
