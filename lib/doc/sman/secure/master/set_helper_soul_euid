/*
 * Function name: set_helper_soul_euid
 * Description  : The helper soul is intended for wizards to get some commands
 *                for abilities they would not normally enjoy. Thus, the soul
 *                requires a higher access level than normally. Make sure that
 *                only the right object qualifies, though.
