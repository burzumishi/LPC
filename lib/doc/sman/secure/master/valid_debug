(varargs int) valid_debug(object ob, string cmd, mixed arg1, mixed arg2, mixed arg3)
/*
 * Function name: valid_debug
 * Description  : This function is called to see whether the object is allowed
 *                to call the efun debug() if the object is anything but this
 *                object SECURITY. Since we don't want other objects to call
 *                debug other than via SECURITY->do_debug(), we disallow it
 *                for all.
 * Arguments    : object ob - the object calling valid_debug
 *                string cmd - the debug command.
 *                mixed arg1 - the argument 1 to debug.
 *                mixed arg2 - the argument 2 to debug.
 *                mixed arg3 - the argument 3 to debug.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - allowed/ disallowed.
