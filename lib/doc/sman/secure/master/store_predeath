(void) store_predeath()
/*
 * Function name: store_predeath
 * Description  : Just before the death-modifications are made to a player
 *                file, we secure a copy. Note: this routine moves the
 *                player file. It relies on a new copy being saved shortly
 *                after the call to this routine, so we don't have to make
 *                a costly copy, but can rely on moving it.
