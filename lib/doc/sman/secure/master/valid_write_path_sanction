(static int) valid_write_path_sanction(string writer, string euid, string path)
/*
 * Function name: valid_write_path_sanction
 * Description  : This function can be used to query whether there is a
 *                write sanction set that allows 'writer' to read the
 *                directory 'path' in 'euid'. Note that there is no check
 *                on the arguments, which means the first argument _must_
 *                be in lower case.
 * Arguments    : string writer - the euid that wants to write.
 *                string euid   - the euid that 'writer' wants to write.
 *                string path   - the path that 'writer' wants to write within
 *                                the directory of 'euid' starting with "/".
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - allowed/disallowed.
