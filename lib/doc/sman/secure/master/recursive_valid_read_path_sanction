/*
 * Function name: recursive_valid_read_path_sanction
 * Description  : This function will in a loop test the complete path in
 *                'parts' to see whether 'reader' has the right to read that
 *                directory in 'dname'. It doesn't really recurse, but loop.
 * Arguments    : string reader - the euid that wants to read.
 *                string euid   - the euid that 'reader' wants to read.
 *                string *parts - the parts that compose the path.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - allowed/disallowed.
