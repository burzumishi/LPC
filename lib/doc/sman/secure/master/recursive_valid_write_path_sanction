(static int) recursive_valid_write_path_sanction(string writer, string dname, string *parts)
/*
 * Function name: recursive_valid_write_path_sanction
 * Description  : This function will in a loop test the complete path in
 *                'parts' to see whether 'writer' has the right to write that
 *                directory in 'dname'. It doesn't really recurse, but loop.
 * Arguments    : string writer - the euid that wants to write.
 *                string euid   - the euid that 'writer' wants to write.
 *                string *parts - the parts that compose the path.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - allowed/disallowed.
