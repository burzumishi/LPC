/* save_ed_setup and restore_ed_setup are called by the ed to maintain
   individual options settings. These functions are located in the master
   object so that the local gods can decide what strategy they want to use.

/*
 * The wizard object 'who' wants to save his ed setup. It is saved in the
 * file ~wiz_name/.edrc . A test should be added to make sure it is
 * a call from a wizard.

 * Don't care to prevent unauthorized access of this file. Only make sure
