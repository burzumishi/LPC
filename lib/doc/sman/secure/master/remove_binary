/*
 * Function name: remove_binary
 * Description  : This function removes a binary file from the game. This
 *                is (presently) necessary when updating a file because
 *                otherwise the binary isn't updated when you move an older
 *                file over it.
 * Arguments    : string path - the fully qualified path to the file,
 *                     excluding the "/binaries" part.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - success/failure.
