/*
 * Function name: query_recover
 * Description  : Called to check whether this armour is recoverable.
 *                If you have variables you want to recover yourself,
 *                you have to redefine this function, keeping at least
 *                the filename and the armour recovery variables, like
 *                they are queried below.
 *                If, for some reason, you do not want your armour to
 *                recover, you should define the function and return 0.
 * Returns      : string - the default recovery string.
