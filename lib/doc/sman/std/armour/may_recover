(nomask void) may_recover()
/*
 * Function name: may_recover
 * Description  : In some situations it is undesirable to have an armour 
 *                not recover. This function may then be used to force the
 *                armour to be recoverable.
 *
 *                This function may _only_ be called when a craftsman sells
 *                in armour he created to a player! It may expressly not be
 *                called in armours that are to be looted from NPC's!
