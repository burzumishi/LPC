(public int) do_glance(int brief)
/*
 * Function name: do_glance
 * Description  : This is the routine describing rooms to livings. It will
 *                print the long or short description of the room, the
 *                possible exits, all visible non-living and living objects
 *                in the room (but not this_object() itself) and then it
 *                will print possible attacks going on. Note that this
 *                function performs a write(), so this_player() will get the
 *                descriptions printed to him/her.
 * Arguments    : int brief - if true, write the short-description,
 *                            else write the long-description.
 * Returns      : int 1 - always.
