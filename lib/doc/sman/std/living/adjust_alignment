(public void) adjust_alignment(int align)
/*
 * Function name: adjust_alignment
 * Description  : When a player has solved a quest, his alignment may be
 *                adjusted if the quest is considered good or evil. This
 *                may only be done when the player receives experience and
 *                the quest bit is subsequently being set. When a quest is
 *                considered solvable for all players in the game, ie both
 *                'good' and 'evil' players, no alignment should be given
 *                out.
 * Arguments    : int align - the alignment of the quest. this should be
 *                            a value in the range -1000 .. 1000 and acts
 *                            the same as alignment in combat, though in
 *                            this case, 'good' players should naturally
 *                            receive positive alignment (ie solve good
 *                            quests).
