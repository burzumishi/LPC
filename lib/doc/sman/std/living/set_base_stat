/*
 * Function name: set_base_stat
 * Description  : Sets the value of a specific stat to a new value. It is
 *                possible to give a deviation from the basic value to add
 *                randomness.
 * Arguments    : int stat - The stat-number as defined in <ss_types.h>.
 *                int value - the new value to set the stat to.
 *                int deviation - The deviation in percentage from the value
 *                    that you set which will be randomly applied per stat.
 *                    A stat value of 50 and a deviation of 10% leads to a
 *                    stat value in the range 45-55. Maximum deviation: 50%
 *                    Default: 0%
 * Returns      : int - the value of the stat, or 0 if failed.
