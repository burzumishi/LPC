(public string) race_sound()
/*
 * Function name: race_sound
 * Description  : This function returns the VBFC value for the sound a
 *                particular living hears when this player speaks. It
 *                operates on previous_object(-1). Notice that we use
 *                query_race rather than query_race_name since the first
 *                will always return a true and valid race name. The
 *                person speaking is this_player().
 * Returns      : string - the race sound the receiver hears.
