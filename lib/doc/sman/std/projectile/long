( varargs public mixed) long(string str, object for_obj)
/*
 * Function name: long
 * Description  : Describe the object or one pseudo item in it. This
 *                resolves possible VBFC. This long function appends
 *                the broken status of a projectile to the long 
 *                description that get_projectile_long returns. You 
 *                should probably redefine get_projectile_long instead 
 *                of this function.
 * Arguments    : string str - the pseudo-item to describe. This is an
 *                             item added with add_item. If this is 0, it
 *                             will return the description of the whole
 *                             object.
 *                object for_obj - the object trying to get the long.
 * Returns      : string - the description of the object or pseudo-item.
