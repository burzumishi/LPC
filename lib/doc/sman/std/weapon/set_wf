(void) set_wf(object obj)
/*
 * Function name: set_wf
 * Description  : To do special checks or processing when a weapon is wielded
 *                or unwielded. the routines wield and unwield can be defined
 *                either in this object, or in an external object.
 *
 *                mixed wield(object weapon) { }
 *                mixed unwield(object weapon) { } 
 *
 *                Note that while wield() may operate on this_player(), the
 *                unwield() routine cannot rely on that. In unwield(), use
 *                the query_wielded() routine to find out who is wielding it.
 *
 *                Those functions can return:
 *                   0 - No effect; the weapon can be wielded / unwielded.
 *                   1 - It can be wielded / unwielded but no text should be
 *                       printed (it was done in the function).
 *                  -1 - It can not be wielded / unwielded. A default fail
 *                       message will be written.
 *                 str - It can not be wielded / unwielded. The string 'str'
 *                       is the fail message to print.
 *
 * Arguments     : object obj - the object that defines the routines.
