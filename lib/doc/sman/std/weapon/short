(public varargs string) short(object for_obj)
/*
 * Function name: short
 * Description  : The short description. We modify it when the weapon is
 *                broken. There is a little caveat if the wizard has not
 *                set a short description since it will double the
 *                adjective 'broken'.
 * Arguments    : object for_obj - the object that wants to know.
 * Returns      : string - the description.
