/*
 * I apologise for this abomination.  It does a heapsort in place.
 * I made the "pass" variable in order to reuse the code for both
 * building the heap and restoring the heap during the sort.  Pass 0
 * builds the heap, pass 1 does the sort.
 *
 * The while loop contains the main "make_heap" code.  
 *
 * The algorithm is much simpler than this implementation, but this
 * is done without benefit of recursion, global variables, or in/out
 * parameter passing.
