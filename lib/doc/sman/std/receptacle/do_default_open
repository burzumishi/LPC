(public int) do_default_open(string str)
/*
 * Function name: do_default_open
 * Description  : Try to open one or more chests. This command does not allow
 *                the use of specific tricks to prevent the command parser to
 *                try the open command on each container in his/her presence
 *                for the command should obviously also work on doors and
 *                such.
 *                However, with the use of the TEMP_LIBCONTAINER_CHECKED
 *                property, there will hardly be any loss of cpu-time.
 * Arguments    : str - the rest of the command line by the mortal
 * Returns      : 1 = success, 0 = failure.
