(void) reset_receptacle()
/*
 * Function name: reset_receptacle
 * Description  : If you want to make this receptacle reset at a regular
 *                interval this is the call to make. As this is just a
 *                container with some extra functionality you can also use
 *                the function reset_container(). Do not forget that you
 *                must call enable_reset() from your create function to
 *                actually make this object reset.
