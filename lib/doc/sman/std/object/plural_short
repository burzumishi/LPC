/*
 * Function name: plural_short
 * Description  : Give the plural short description of this object. If a
 *                plural short has been set with set_pshort, VBFC will be

 *                short set with set_pshort, it will always return 0. The
 *                gamedriver will then compute the plural shor.
 * Arguments    : object for_obj - the object that wants to know the plural
 *                                 short.
 * Returns      : string - the plural short description.
