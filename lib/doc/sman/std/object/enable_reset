(nomask void) enable_reset(int factor = 100)
/*
 * Function name: enable_reset
 * Description  : Used to enable or disable resets in an object. The reset
 *                interval is based on the factor given as argument to this
 *                function. By default, the reset time will averagely be
 *                slightly larger than one hour. By using a factor, this period
 *                can be increased or decreased, using the following formula:
 *                    Reset interval = 90 minutes * (100 / factor)
 * Arguments    : (optional) int factor - when omitted, the factor will default
 *                to 100 (90 minutes). Use 0 to disable resets in this object.
 *                Valid values for the factor are in the range 20 to 200, which
 *                make for a reset interval of approximately 450 to 45 minutes
 *                on average.
