(public void) linkdeath_hook(object player, int linkdeath)
/*
 * Function name: linkdeath_hook
 * Description  : This routine is called when the player who carries it goes
 *                linkdead, or revives from linkdeath.
 *                Warning: All items in the inventory of the item share the
 *                same time cycle, so keep use of this routine to the bare
 *                minimum. In general, try to avoid using this routine.
 * Arguments    : object player - the player who linkdied, or revived, i.e.
 *                    the environment() of this item.
 *                int linkdeath - 1/0 - if true, the player linkdied, else
 *                    he revives from linkdeath.
 * Notice       : This function does not actually exist in /std/object. We have
 *                fooled the document maker into believing it does, so we can
 *                present this information. Do not call ::linkdeath_hook().
