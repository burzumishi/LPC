(public int) remove_item(string name)
/*
 * Function name: remove_item
 * Description  : Removes one item from the list of additional items. All
 *                instances that include the name are removed. If you have
 *                added multiple synonyms, it suffices to remove only one
 *                in order to remove the whole group. For example:
 *                    add_item( ({ "floor", "ground" }), "It's flat.\n");
 *                is cancelled out by:
 *                    remove_item("ground");
 * Arguments    : string name - the name of item to remove.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - if true, it was removed.
