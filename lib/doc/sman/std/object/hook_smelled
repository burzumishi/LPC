(public void) hook_smelled(string str)
/*
 * Function name: hook_smelled
 * Description  : By defining this function in an object or room, you can
 *                create an effect when a player tries to smell it. This
 *                function is called after the messages are printed to the
 *                players in the room, so what you do here will not interefere
 *                with that. Naturally you can generate extra messages, make
 *                the player choke, or whatever.
 *                The acting player is this_player().
 * Arguments    : string str - This argument is only valid in rooms, and then
 *                    used to hold the name of the add-item in the room the
 *                    player smelled. In other objects, this argument may be
 *                    omitted.
 * Notice       : This function does not actually exist in /std/object. We have
 *                fooled the document maker into believing it does, so we can
 *                present this information. Do not call ::hook_smelled().
