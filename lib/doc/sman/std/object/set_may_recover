(nomask void) set_may_recover()
/*
 * Function name: set_may_recover
 * Description  : In some situations it is undesirable to have a weapon
 *                not recover. This function may then be used to force the
 *                weapon to be recoverable.
 *
 *                This function may _only_ be called when a craftsman sells
 *                a weapon he created to a player! It may expressly not be
 *                called in weapons that are to be looted from NPC's!
