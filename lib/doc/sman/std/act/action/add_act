/*
 * Function name: add_act
 * Description:   Adds an action string that the monster will randomly do.
 * Arguments:     str: Text
 *                flag: True if the action is to occur forever (this
 *                      is frowned upon, so have a good reason). If 0 or
 *                      not present, the action will only occur in the
 *                      presence of a player, or for a short time after
 *                      the monster is alone.
