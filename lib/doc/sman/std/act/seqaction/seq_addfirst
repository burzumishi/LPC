(int) seq_addfirst(string name, mixed cmd)
/*
 *  Description: Add a command or an array of commands first in a sequence.
 *               Note that a command can be VBFC. This enables calls to
 *               functions that returns the actual command. This function
 *               can of course do all sorts of things. If 'cmd' is a number
 *               it is interpreted as a delayvalue (in heartbeats) until
 *               the next command is issued. 
 *
 *               The sequence 'name' must be created with seq_new(name)
 *               prior to the call of this function.
