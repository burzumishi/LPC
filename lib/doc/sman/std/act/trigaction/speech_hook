(public void) speech_hook(string verb, object actor, string adverb, object *oblist,     string text, int target)
/*
 * Function name: speech_hook
 * Description  : Whenever someone speaks, this function is called to let the
 *                livings in the room know about the speech. This way we can
 *                avoid the usage of all those costly triggers.
 * Arguments    : string verb - the name of the speech command used. This is
 *                    the command the player typed, query_verb(). For regular
 *                    speech "say" is used even for'.
 *                object actor - the actor of the speech.
 *                string adverb - the adverb used with the speech. If there is
 *                    one, it's prefixed with a space so you can use the
 *                    adverb in your reaction if you please without having
 *                    to parse it further.
 *                object *oblist - the targets of the emotion, if any.
 *                string text - the text that was uttered. Whispering is only
 *                    understood if you are the recipient.
 *                int target - can have three states:
 *                   -1 - speech was directed at someone else
 *                    0 - speech was directed at nobody in particular
 *                    1 - speech was directed at me.
