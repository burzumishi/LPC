/*
 * Function name: emote_hook
 * Description  : Whenever an emotion is performed on this living, or when it
 *                is performed in the room in general, this function is called
 *                to let the living know about the emotion. This way we can
 *                avoid the usage of all those costly triggers.
 * Arguments    : string emote - the name of the emotion performed. This
 *                    always is the command the player typed, query_verb().
 *                object actor - the actor of the emotion.
 *                string adverb - the adverb used with the emotion, if there
 *                    was one. When an adverb is possible with the emotion,
 *                    this argument is either "" or it will contain the used
 *                    emotion, preceded by a " " (space). This way you can
 *                    use the adverb in your reaction if you please without
 *                    having to parse it further.
 *                object *oblist - the targets of the emotion, if any.
 *                int cmd_attr - the command attributes, if any.
 *                int target - if true, this object was a target of the emote.
