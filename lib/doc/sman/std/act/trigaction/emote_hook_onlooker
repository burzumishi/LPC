/*
 * Function name: emote_hook_onlooker
 * Description  : Whenever this living sees an emotion being performed on
 *                someone else, this function is called to let the living know
 *                about the emotion. This way we can avoid the usage of all
 *                those costly triggers.
 * Arguments    : string emote - the name of the emotion performed. This
 *                    always is the command the player typed, query_verb().
 *                object actor - the actor of the emotion.
 *                string adverb - the adverb used with the emotion, if there
 *                    was one. When an adverb is possible with the emotion,
 *                    this argument is either "" or it will contain the used
 *                    emotion, preceded by a " " (space). This way you can
 *                    use the adverb in your reaction if you please without
 *                    having to parse it further.
 *                object *oblist - the targets of the emotion.
 *                int cmd_attr - the command attributes.
