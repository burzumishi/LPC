/*
 * Function name: emote_hook_actor
 * Description  : Whenever a living performs an emote on others, this hook is
 *                called. This way we can avoid the usage of all those costly
 *                triggers.
 * Arguments    : string emote - the name of the emotion performed. This
 *                    always is the command the player typed, query_verb().
 *                object *oblist - the targets of the emotion.
