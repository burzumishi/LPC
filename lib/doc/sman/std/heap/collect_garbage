(void) collect_garbage()
/*
 * Function name: collect_garbage
 * Description  : When the heap is still in the void some time after it was
 *                cloned, we destruct it to save memory. If you really do not
 *                want this, mask no_garbage_collection() to return 1, and
 *                have a good reason to explain this when asked by an arch.
