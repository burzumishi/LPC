/*
 * Function name: mobile_deny_objects
 * Description:   This function is called from VBFC and NPC_M_NO_ACCEPT_GIVE
 *		  prop checking. If this mobile is intelligent enough he might
 *		  recognize that someone is trying to load him down before
 *		  attacking and then he doesn't accept any more objects. This
 *		  is merely default behaviour. Feel free to code something
 *		  different
 * Returns:       A message that will be printed to the player or 0
