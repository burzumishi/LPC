(public void) set_exp_factor(int proc_xp)
/*
 * Function name: set_exp_factor
 * Description  : Using this function you can set a percentage on the basic
 *                experience that is given out when killing this living. For
 *                instance, an NPC with special (magical) abilities might be
 *                more difficult to kill than one would guess based on the
 *                stats alone. Works only on NPC's. Range: 50% to 200%
 * Arguments    : int proc_xp - the percentage of the base experience that is
 *                    awarded. I.e. to give out 40% extra exp, set to 140.
