/*
 * Function name: set_stats
 * Description  : Allows to set all stats of an NPC in a single call. The
 *                order is the same as the default stat order (see ss_types.h)
 *                and both general stats and guild stats may be set. It is
 *                possible to give a deviation from the basic values to add
 *                randomness.
 * Arguments    : int *stats - Array of stat values in order of the basic stat
 *                    list. The array may include both base stats and guild
 *                    stats. The length of the array may vary.
 *              : int deviation - The deviation in percentage from the value
 *                    that you set which will be randomly applied per stat.
 *                    A stat value of 50 and a deviation of 10% leads to a
 *                    stat value in the range 45-55. Maximum deviation: 50%
 *                    Default: 0%
