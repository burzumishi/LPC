/*
 * Function name: load_headers
 * Description  : Load the headers when the board is created. This is done
 *                in a little alarm since it is also possible to configure
 *                the board by cloning it and then calling the set-functions
 *                externally. This function also sets the fuse that makes
 *                it impossible to alter the board-specific properties.
