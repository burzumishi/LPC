(public int) restore_item(object player, string item)
/*
 * Function name: restore_item
 * Descritpion  : Called to restore a certain item to a player. This means the
 *                item has to be cloned into the player and customised when
 *                so required. In principle, this routine is only called when
 *                the items have been checked for restoration, but you are
 *                suggested to perform the check to see whether the player is
 *                entitled to the object. In principle, no text needs to be
 *                printed to the player inside this routine.
 * Arguments    : object player - the player who needs an item restored.
 *                string item - the code name of the item. This is the string
 *                     returned as index in the mapping that was returned from
 *                     query_restore_items().
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - if true, the restoration is successful, else 0.
