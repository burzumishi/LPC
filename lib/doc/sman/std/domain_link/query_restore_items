/*
 * Function name: query_restore_items
 * Descritpion  : Called to find out which items might be restored into the
 *                player. This could be guild items and quest items alike.
 *                Note that this routine is a test routine only. No action
 *                should be taken. It should return only those items that
 *                the player is entitled to, but that are missing in the
 *                player. The returned mapping looks as follows:
 * 
 *                    ([ (string) code : (string) description ])
 *
 *                The code is an internal string used to call restore_item().
 *                It should be unique for all items, and preferably contains
 *                the domain name in it. The description is a text displayed
 *                to the player that explains the item to be restored. It
 *                should be no more than 70 characters.
 *                This is a silent function. No text printed to the player!
 * Arguments    : object player - the player to check for restoration items.
 * Returns      : mapping - the items possible for restoration on this player.
 *
 * Example: ([ "Domain_rabbit_quest": "Lucky charm from Jack Rabbit quest" ])
