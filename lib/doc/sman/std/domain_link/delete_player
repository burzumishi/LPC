(public void) delete_player(string name)
/*
 * Function name: delete_player
 * Description  : This function is called every time a player is deleted from
 *                the game. It can be used for domain specific code that is
 *                called to clean up information about the player.
 * Notice       : Do NOT redefine this function if it is not used. For extra
 *                stability this function is called using an alarm, so if it
 *                is not used, let us not waste alarms on functions that do not
 *                do anything anyways.
 * Arguments    : string name - the name of the deleted player.
