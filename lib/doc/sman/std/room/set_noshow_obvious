(public void) set_noshow_obvious(int obv)
/*
 * Function name: set_noshow_obvious
 * Description  : With this function you can set that all exits in this room
 *                are non-obvious. The fifth argument of add_exit() should
 *                only be used if there are also obvious exits. Using this
 *                is quicker when dealing with all exits.
 * Arguments    : int obv - 1/0 - if true then all exits are hidden.
