(varargs public object) link_room(string lfile, mixed dest, int pos)
/*
 * Function name: link_room
 * Description:   Create a corridor room. Set the descriptions of it.
 *                Does not add exits. This is supposed to be replaced by 
 *                the actual room inheriting this standard room. It is supposed
 *                to set proper descriptions (long and short) instead of
 *                copying the endpoint description. Corridor rooms are
 *		  created when the delay value in the third parameter to
 *		  add_exit() is a negative integer. Length of corridor is
 *		  the absolute value of the delay parameter.
 * Arguments:	  lfile: Suggested filename to clone to get a corridor room.
 *                dest:  The other endpoint of the corridor.
 *		  pos:   The position away from this startpoint
 * Returns:       Objectpointer of the cloned room.
