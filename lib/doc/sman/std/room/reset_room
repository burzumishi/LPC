(void) reset_room()
/*
 * Function name: reset_room
 * Description  : This function should be redefined to make the room reset
 *                every half hour or so. If you redefine it, you do not have
 *                to call enable_reset() since we call it as part of our
 *                service ;-) Note that this service is only valid for rooms.
