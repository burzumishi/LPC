/*
 * Function name: add_exit
 * Description  : Add one exit to the room. Only the first and the second
 *                argument are mandatory. The rest is optional.
 * Arguments    : string place - The filename of the room to move to. This can
 *                    be an absolute or relative path, but also just the
 *                    filename if that is in the same directory. Do not add
 *                    the trailing ".c".
 *                string cmd - The command the player has to give to move. Use
 *                    the long version of the "southwest". The short version
 *                    "sw" is automatically added.
 *                mixed efunc - The delay value. This can be VBFC. Possible
 *                    delay values are:
 *                    = 0: Player can move directly to destination.
 *                    = 1: Cannot use this exit, and do not try others.
 *                    > 1: Cannot use this exit, but try the rest.
 *                    < 0: Move is done with delay (see link_room)
 *                mixed tired - How much more tired the player should become
 *                    from walking in that direction. Default value is 1.
 *                    This can be VBFC.
 *                mixed non_obvious - When true, the player will not see this
 *                    exit, but he can use it. VBFC can be used here.
 * Returns      : int 1/0 - success/failure.
