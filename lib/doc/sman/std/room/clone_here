(public object) clone_here(string file)
/*
 * Function name: clone_here
 * Description  : The behaviour of this function is exactly the same as the
 *                efun clone_object(). It clones the 'file' and returns the
 *                objectpointer to that object. However, it will also add
 *                the object to a list of items that 'belongs' in this room.
 *                This means that the presence of this object in the room will
 *                not prevent the room from being cleaned with clean_up().
 * Arguments    : string file - the path to the item to clone.
 * Returns      : object - the objectpointer to the clone.
