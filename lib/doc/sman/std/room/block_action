/*
 * Function name: block_action
 * Description:   Rooms can prevent targeted commands from being executed
 *                using this function.  By default, we just check to see

 *                this can be redefined to block commands based on other
 *                criteria.
 *
 * Arguments:     string cmd    - the name of the executed command
 *                object actor  - the command performer
 *                object target - the target of the command
 *                int cmd_type  - the command attributes (from cmdparse.h) 
 * Returns:       0 - command allowed
 *                1 - command blocked, no error message provided
 *                string - command blocked, use string as error message.
