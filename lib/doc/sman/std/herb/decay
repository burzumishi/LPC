(int) decay()
/* 
 * Function name: decay
 * Description:   This function is called with an alarm, and simulates the
 *                somewhat rapid decay of herbs - herbs lose their effect
 *                soon after being picked, if they don't dry and last longer.
 *                To make a herb dry, do set_dryable() from create_herb().
 *                set_dried() can be used to dry the herb immediately.
