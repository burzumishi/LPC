(nomask string) long_func()
/*
 * Function name: long_func
 * Description:   This is an VBFC function for the set_long in the herb, which
 *                tests if the player examining it can identify it, before
 *                returning the appropriate long-description. To make this
 *                work, you must be sure to do set_id_long(str) and
 *                set_unid_long(str) from the create_herb() function.
