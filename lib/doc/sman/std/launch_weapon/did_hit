/*
 * Function name: did_hit
 * Description:   Tells us that we hit something. Should produce combat
 *                messages to all relevant parties. If the weapon
 *                chooses not to handle combat messages then a default
 *                message is generated. This function is meant to be overridden
 *                by launch_weapon implementations. Remember to call
 *                ::did_hit() since this function is also responsible
 *                for moving the missiles and reseting the launch_weapon
 *                for the next round.
 *
 * Arguments:     aid:   The attack id
 *                hdesc: The hitlocation description.
 *                phurt: The %hurt made on the enemy
 *                enemy: The enemy who got hit
 *                dt:    The current damagetype
 *                phit:  The %success that we made with our weapon
 *                dam:   The actual damage caused by this weapon in hit points
 * Returns:       True if it handled combat messages, returning a 0 will let
 *                the normal routines take over
