/*
 * Function name:   compute_values
 * Description:     Recursively compute the values of the given list of
 *                  objects. If the objects contain objects with a value
 *                  that value is also taken into account. Only 2/3 of the
 *		    actual value will be stored. Also, coins aren't included
 *		    in the value summed up. Don't figure objects that can
 *		    be recovered into this list.
 * Arguments:       ob_list: The list of objects to sum up.
