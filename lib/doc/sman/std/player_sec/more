(public nomask varargs int) more(mixed arg, int start, function func)
/*
 * Function name: more
 * Description  : Call this function in a player like explained in the header
 *                of this file in order to let him/her read a text with more.
 *                There are three options:
 *                  player->more(string filename, int start)
 *                  player->more(string *lines)
 *                  player->more(string text)
 *
 * Arguments    : mixed arg - the filename of the file to read or the text to
 *                    read itself. If it's the text, it may be an array of
 *                    lines or a single string concatenated with newlines (\n).
 *                int start - for files this must be the index to the first
 *                    line to read (first line == 1). When <arg> contains the
 *                    text itself, this variable should be 0 or omitted.
 *                function func - the function to call when the player is
 *                    done reading the text.
 * Returns      : int 1 - always.
