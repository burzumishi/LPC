/*
 * Function name: create_torch
 * Description:   The standard create. This has some standard settings on
 *		  long and short descriptions, but don't be afraid to change
 *		  them.
 *                The pshort has to be set to some value, otherwise the short
 *                description of several objects will look ugly.
