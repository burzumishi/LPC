/*
 * Function name: enter_env
 * Description  : A torch that is burned out will decay after some time. The
 *                decaying starts when the object is put in a room, and it
 *                stops again when picked up. Check query_torch_may_decay()
 *                to see if it is allowed to decay.
 * Arguments    : object to - where the torch is going.
 *                object from - where the torch comes from.
