(public int) light_me_after_delay()
/*
 * Function name: light_me_after_delay
 * Description  : Routine that actually lights the torch after a delay. Why
 *                exactly this is used, I don't know. Maybe to let the
 *                previous command finish with the old light value?
 * Returns      : int 1 - no reason, really, since it's called from an alarm.
